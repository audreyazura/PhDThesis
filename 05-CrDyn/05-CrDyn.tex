	To initialize and read-out the Cr spin, we developed a two wavelengths pump-probe experiment. A circularly polarized single mode laser (\emph{resonant pump}) tuned on a X-Cr level is used to pump the Cr spin (i.e., empty the spin state under resonant excitation). Then, a second laser, tuned on an excited state of the QD (\emph{quasi-resonant probe}), injects excitons independently of the Cr spin $S_z$ and drives the Cr to an effective spin temperature where the three ground states $S_z=0$,$\pm1$ are populated \cite{LafuenteCrQD}. By recording the PL of a X-Cr lines in circular polarization under this periodic sequence of excitation, we can monitor the time evolution of the population of a given Cr spin state.

	\label{PumpingExp}
	\end{figure}		
		
	The main features of the optical pumping experiment are presented in Fig.~\ref{PumpingExp}(a). The QD is excited on the high energy state of X-Cr with $\sigma-$ photons (X-Cr state $|S_z=-1,-1\rangle$). This excitation can only create an exciton in the dot if the Cr spin is $S_z=-1$. An absorption followed by possible spin-flips of the Cr in the exchange field of the exciton progressively decreases the population of $S_z=-1$. After this pumping sequence, the resonant pump is switched off and followed by the non-resonant probe.

	A clear signature of the optical pumping appears on the time evolution of the PL intensity of the low energy bright exciton line (4). The PL of this line during the probe pulse, recorded in opposite circular polarization with the resonant pump, depends on the population of $S_z=-1$. It strongly differs between the two pump-probe sequences where the resonant pump is on or off. The difference of intensity at the beginning of the probe pulse is a measurement of the efficiency of the pumping. The PL transient during the probe pulse corresponds to a destruction of the non-equilibrium population distribution prepared by the pump. As expected for an increase of the Cr spin temperature, the population of the ground spin state $S_z=0$ also decreases during the probe pulse. This decrease directly appears in the time evolution of the amplitude of the central X-Cr lines during the probe pulse (Det. (3) in Fig.~\ref{PumpingExp}(a)). The increase of the population of $S_z=0$ during the probe pulse shows that the population of $S_z=-1$ has been partially transferred to $S_z=0$ during the resonant pumping sequence.
	
	A more direct way to probe the optical pumping speed and efficiency is to monitor the time evolution of the PL during the resonant excitation by the pump pulse. Under resonant excitation on the high energy X-Cr line, an exciton spin-flip with conservation of the Cr spin can produce a PL on the low energy line \cite{ClaireOptInit}. In this process, the exciton flips its spin by emitting (or absorbing) an acoustic phonon. Such spin-flip is enhanced by the large acoustic phonon density of states at the energy of the inter-level splitting induced by the exchange interaction with the Cr spin which act as an effective magnetic field \cite{ExcSpinRelaxQD,ExcSpinDecay}. The resulting weak resonant PL signal depends on the occupation of the Cr state $S_z=-1$ and is used to monitor the time dependence of the spin selective absorption of the QD.
	
	The time evolution of the PL of the low energy line of X-Cr under an excitation on the high energy line is presented in Fig.~\ref{PumpingExp}(a) for two different pump-probe sequences: probe on and probe off. When the probe laser is on, a large effective Cr spin temperature is established before each pumping pulse. The amplitude of the resonant PL is maximum at the beginning of the pump pulse ($I_1$) and progressively decreases. A decrease of about 80\% is observed with a characteristic decay time in the tens of $ns$ range. When the probe laser is off, the initial amplitude of the PL transient during the pump pulse is significantly weaker. This decrease is a consequence of the conservation of the out of equilibrium Cr spin distribution during the dark time between two consecutive pumping pulses.
	
	The steady state resonant PL intensity reached at the end of the pump pulse ($I_2$) depends on the optical pumping efficiency which is controlled by the ratio of the spin-flip rate for the Cr spin in the exchange field of the exciton and the relaxation of the Cr spin in the empty dot. However, even with cross-circularly polarized excitation/detection, this steady state PL can also contain a weak contribution from an absorption in the acoustic phonon sideband of the low energy line~\cite{BesombesAccPhon}. Fig.~\ref{PumpingExp}(b) presents the amplitude of the resonant PL detected on the low energy line for a detuning of the pump around the high energy line. A resonance is observed in the initial amplitude $I_1$ of the PL. It reflects the energy and excitation power dependence of the absorption of the QD. A small decrease of the steady state PL $I_2$ is also observed at the resonance. As displayed in Fig.~\ref{PumpingExp}(c), the corresponding normalized amplitude of the pumping transient, $(I_1-I_2)/I_2$, presents a clear resonant behaviour demonstrating the excitation energy dependence of the optical pumping process. The width of the resonance ($\sim 100\mu eV$) is the width of the QD's absorption broadened by the fluctuating environment~\cite{SubnanoSpectralDiff}.

		\subsection{Dynamics of the Cr spin under optical excitation}
		
%			\subsubsection*{Autocorrelation and cross-correlation}		
		
		We performed auto-correlation of the photoluminescence (PL) intensity emitted by individual lines of an isolated Cr-doped QD to probe the dynamics of the magnetic atom under continuous wave (CW) optical excitation. A Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) setup was used for this purpose. In these start-stop experiments, the detection of the first photon indicates by its energy and polarization that the Cr spin has a given orientation. The probability of detection of a second photon with the same energy and polarization is proportional to the probability of conserving this spin state. The time evolution of the auto-correlation is a probe of the spin dynamics in the Cr-doped QD.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\fcapside{\caption{Auto-correlation of the PL intensity collected in circular polarization on the X-Cr lines (1), (4) and (5) (as defined in Fig.~\ref{PumpingExp}) and compared with the auto-correlation of the exciton in a non-magnetic QD (black line). The curves are shifted for clarity. For line (1), the auto-correlation is also recorded under a transverse magnetic field (blue line).}\label{AutocorExpCr}}	
	{\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Pictures/AutocorPeaks.eps}
	\end{center}}
	\end{figure}	
	
			To observe the time fluctuations of the Cr spin under CW optical excitation, we used the statistics of time arrivals of the photons emitted by a Cr-doped QD given by the second order correlation function g$^{(2)}(\tau)$ of the PL intensity. Fig.~\ref{AutocorExpCr} shows g$^{(2)}(\tau)$ for the lines (1), (4) and (5) recorded in circular polarization. These signals are compared with the auto-correlation obtained for the PL of a non-magnetic QD which is characteristic of a single-photon emitter with a dip (anti-bunching) at short delays. The width of the anti-bunching is given by the lifetime of the emitter and the generation rate of excitons and its depth is limited by the time resolution of the HBT setup. As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{AutocorExpCr}, typical non-magnetic CdTe/ZnTe QDs do not present any significant bunching induced by charge fluctuations \cite{QDAutocor,IndistPhoton}. A similar auto-correlation on a X-Cr PL line still presents a reduced coincidence rate near zero delay, but it is mainly characterized by a large photon bunching with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the 20 ns range. This large bunching reflects an intermittency in the emission of a given line of the QD coming from fluctuations of the Cr spin in a 10 ns timescale as it will be confirmed by cross-correlation measurements.

		The amplitude of the bunching reaches 5 for line (1) and is slightly weaker for the lower energy lines. In a simple picture of blinking where the selected QD line can be either in a state ON or OFF, the amplitude of the bunching is given by $\Gamma_{OFF}/\Gamma_{ON}$, ratio of the transition rates from OFF to ON, $\Gamma_{ON}$, and from ON to OFF, $\Gamma_{OFF}$ \cite{SubnanoSpectDiff}. An amplitude of bunching larger than 1 is then expected in a multilevel spin system where, after a spin relaxation, multiple spin-flips are usually required to come back to the initial state ($\Gamma_{ON}<\Gamma_{OFF}$). Let us finally note that the bunching signal is not affected by a weak transverse magnetic field ($B_x=0.42$ T in Fig.~\ref{AutocorExpCr}). This confirms the presence of a large strain induced magnetic anisotropy $D_0$ which splits the Cr and X-Cr states and blocks their precession in a magnetic field.
		
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\fcapside{\caption{Auto-correlation of the PL intensity recorded in circular polarization on the high energy X-Cr line (1) for different excitation powers. The inset shows the corresponding FWHM of the bunching signal versus excitation power.}\label{AutocorPW}}	
	{\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=7cm]{Pictures/AutocorPw.eps}
	\end{center}}
	\end{figure}
	
	One should note that the observed spin dynamics depends on the optical excitation power. Increasing the excitation power significantly reduces the width of the bunching (Fig.~\ref{AutocorPW}), linked to an increase of the Cr spin fluctuations. Within the X-Cr complex, the electron-Cr exchange interaction and the hole-Cr exchange interaction in the presence of heavy-hole/light-hole mixing can both induce spin-flips of the Cr. Though weak, the probability of such spin flips increases with the occupation of the QD with an exciton and dominates the spin dynamics in the high excitation regime required for the photon correlation measurements.
	
	The excitation power dependence shows that the measured width of the bunching is not limited by the intrinsic Cr spin relaxation time $\tau_{Cr}$. This gives a lower bound for $\tau_{Cr}$ in the 20 ns range. A shorter value would impose, at low excitation intensity, faster spin fluctuations than observed experimentally. The Cr spin relaxation time is ultimately controlled by the interaction with acoustic phonons and could depend on the optical excitation through the generation of non-equilibrium acoustic phonons during the relaxation of injected carriers~\cite{PhotocarrierSpinHeat,EnTransPhotocarrierMn}. It is however expected to be longer than the observed dynamics~\cite{CaoSpinPhonCoupl} and cannot be determined with these measurements which require a large photon count rate.

(b) Longitudinal magnetic field dependence of the cross-correlation signal obtained at low excitation power.}
	\label{Crosscor}
	\end{figure}
	
	To analyze more in detail the spin relaxation channels, cross-correlation measurements were performed on the PL emitted by the high energy and the low energy lines in the same circular polarization. The cross-correlation shows a large anti-bunching with a FWHM in the 10 ns range and g$^{(2)}$(0)$\approx$0.3 (Fig.~\ref{Crosscor}(a)). Whereas the auto-correlation probes the probability for the Cr spin to be conserved, this cross-correlation is a probe of the spin transfer time between the spin states $S_z=+1$ and $S_z=-1$. As for the auto-correlation, the cross-correlation strongly depends on the excitation power. At weak excitation, a spin transfer time of about 20 ns is observed. It is accelerated with the increase of the excitation power (Fig.~\ref{Crosscor}(a)). This transfer time could be controlled by anisotropic in-plane strain which couples Cr spin states separated by two units through an additional term $E(S_x^2-S_y^2)$ in the Cr fine structure Hamiltonian~\cite{LafuenteCrQD}. However, even at low excitation power, the measured transfer time is not affected by a longitudinal magnetic field (Fig.~\ref{Crosscor}(b)). This shows that for such QD the strain anisotropy term $E$ is weak and is not the main parameter controlling the transfer time between the states $S_z=\pm1$. The spin transfer time is dominated by spin-flips induced by the exciton/Cr interaction.

%	\label{CrSpectraPwExp}
%	\end{figure}
%	
%	In order to study the different relaxation path of the system, probing of the emission evolution under excitation power was realized, reported on Fig.~\ref{CrSpectraPwExp}. As expected, the PL is becoming more intense with the augmentation of the excitation laser, since more exciton are produced and thus injected in the quantum dot. However, this power augmentation response is not the same for each of the peaks. The two central peaks, associated with the $|0\rangle$ states, start at about twice the intensity of the $|\pm1\rangle$ peaks for the most intense one, seemingly never reaching their maximum under our power range. However, when lowering the excitation power, they diminish quickly, and even seems to disappear at low energy, when exterior peaks still show luminescence. Plotting this evolution shows that the two central peaks exhibit a super-linear evolution. On the other side, the exterior peaks begin by rising in intensity before diminishing in a sub-linear fashion. This is coherent with the usual picture, where high power populating preferentially X$^2$-Cr states, while low power populates preferentially X-Cr states~\cite{??}. Finally, one can notice that the dark exciton exhibit the same behaviour, but the maximum emission intensity is at slightly lower power than the $|\pm1\rangle$.

%	The results of this evolution are well reproduced by our spin effective Hamiltonian, using the parameters found for the dot from the magneto-optics and the linear polarization fitting. The model results are presented in Fig.~\ref{CrSpectraPwMod}. [NOT SURE, TO BE REDISCUSSED]The super-linear behaviour of the central peaks can be explained by the proximity of dark exciton states. High power excitation can unlock radiative recombination path to states remaining non-radiative at low excitation power~\cite{PwSuperLinInc}. Such states linked to the $|0\rangle$ state make the emission on its peaks present a super-linear behaviour when excited at high power.

%		
%	To identify the main contribution to the observed spin fluctuations, we modelled the auto-correlation of the PL of X-Cr using the full spin level structure of a Cr-doped QD. We calculated the time evolution of the population of the twenty X-Cr states in the excited state of the QD and five Cr states in the ground state by solving numerically the master equation for the corresponding 25 x 25 density matrix $\rho$. The time evolution of the density matrix including relaxation and dephasing processes in the Lindblad form is given by $\partial \rho/\partial t=-i/\hbar[{\cal H},\rho]+L\rho$ where ${\cal H}$ is the Hamiltonian of the complete system ($X$-Cr and Cr) and $L\rho$ describes the coupling or decay channels resulting from an interaction with the environment \cite{SpinQJumps,ephBroad}. The energy levels of the Cr are controlled by the magnetic anisotropy $D_0S_z^2$. The X-Cr Hamiltonian, presented in Ref.\cite{LafuenteCrQD}, contains the energy of the Cr spin states, the carriers-Cr exchange interactions, the electron-hole exchange interaction in a confining potential of low symmetry and the structure of the valence band including heavy-hole/light-hole mixing. $D_0$ in the Cr Hamiltonian and the parameters in the X-Cr Hamiltonian cannot be precisely extracted from the zero magnetic field PL (Fig.~\ref{DotSpectra}(a)). For a qualitative description of the observed spin dynamics, we use in the model typical Cr-doped QD parameters extracted from magneto-optics measurements presented in Ref. \cite{LafuenteCrQD}. These parameters give a X-Cr splitting and a dark/bright excitons mixing similar to the one observed in the QD discussed in this article.
	
		\subsection{Cr spin relaxation in the dark}

		Using resonant optical pumping technique presented in Sec.~\ref{ResOptPump} to prepare and read-out the Cr spin, we performed pump-probe experiments to observe its relaxation time in the absence of carriers (Fig.~\ref{RelaxDark}). A non-equilibrium distribution of the Cr spin population is prepared with a circularly polarized resonant pump pulse on the high energy X-Cr line. The pump laser is then switched off, and switched on again after a dark time $\tau_{dark}$. The amplitude of the pumping transient observed on the resonant PL of the low energy line depends on the Cr spin relaxation during $\tau_{dark}$. As presented in Fig.~\ref{RelaxDark}(b), the amplitude of the transient is fully restored after a dark time of about 10 $\mu$s showing that after this delay the Cr spin is in equilibrium with the lattice temperature (T=5 K). Let us note, however, that the initial amplitude of the pumping transient in this case is weaker than the one observed after a non-resonant probe pulse (Fig.~\ref{PumpingExp}(a)). This means that the non-resonant optical excitation drives the Cr spin to an effective temperature much larger than the lattice temperature.

	From the time delay dependence of the amplitude of the transient, we deduce a Cr relaxation time $\tau_{Cr}\approx1.7$ $\mu$s at B$=0$ T and T$=5$ K. For such neutral QD and in the absence of optical injection of carriers, this spin relaxation is likely to be controlled by the spin-lattice interaction. Despite the large spin-phonon coupling expected for this magnetic atom with an orbital momentum and a strain induced spin splitting in the meV range~\cite{LafuenteCrQD}, the Cr spin relaxation time remains in the $\mu s$ range. This spin memory is long enough for a practical use of Cr in an hybrid spin nano-mechanical system and could even be improved in different QDs structures with weaker biaxial strain~\cite{LucienSFD}, lower magnetic anisotropy splitting and consequently less coupling with acoustic phonons \cite{CaoSpinPhonCoupl}.

	These measurements reveal a significantly different Cr spin-flip times under optical excitation (tens of nanosecond range) and in the dark (microseconds range).	
	
	The $\Delta I/I$ evolution over dark time is used as a measure of the relaxation of the Cr spin: after a long enough time, both lines should stabilize at the same value.	

	\section{Optical Stark effect on an individual Cr spin}
		
		The resonant optical excitation on a X-Cr line can also be used to tune the energy of any Cr spin state through the optical Stark effect~\cite{ClairStarkEffect,CohOptSpectr,EmissionDressedExcBiexc}.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=14.8cm]{Pictures/AutlerTownes.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Energy level of a Cr-doped quantum dot and formation of the dressed-states. We excite resonantly a given transition of the quantum dot with a continuous monochromatic laser (here the $|S_z = +1\rangle \rightarrow |S_z = +1, X_z = +1\rangle$ transition). Considering a mode of $n$, the levels (Cr, $n$) and (X-Cr, $n-1$) are coherently coupled through absorption and stimulated emission of photon. The Rabi splitting $\Omega_r$ between these two levels can be probed in the cross-polarized PL using a second non-resonant probe (as shown on the right part of the diagram). The splitting observed using a third level is the so-called Autler-Townes splitting.}
	\label{StarkPres}
	\end{figure}
	
	At high excitation intensity, a strong coupling with the resonant laser field mixes the states with a Cr spin component $S_z=+1$ in the presence (X-Cr) or absence (Cr alone) of the exciton. In the ground state of the QD (Cr alone) two hybrid matter-field states are created (inset of Fig.~\ref{StarkPres}). Their splitting, $\hbar\Omega_r^{\prime}=\hbar\sqrt{\Omega_r^2+\delta^2}$, depends on the energy detuning of the laser $\hbar\delta$ and on its intensity through the Rabi energy $\hbar\Omega_r$~\cite{ExcDressStatesBeat}. It can be observed in the PL of all the X-Cr states associated with $S_z=+1$: the low energy bright exciton state $|S_z=+1,-1\rangle$ (line (4)) and the dark exciton $|S_z=+1,+2\rangle$ (line (5)), close in energy to the bright exciton and which acquires some oscillator strength through the exciton mixing induced by the electron-hole exchange interaction in a low symmetry QD~\cite{LafuenteCrQD}.

	Such energy shift could be exploited to control the coherent dynamics of the magnetic atom~\cite{OptSignSpinSwitch,MnResSpinDyn}. This optical control technique is presented in Fig.~\ref{StarkSplitandDet}. When a high intensity single mode laser is tuned to the high energy line of X-Cr in $\sigma+$ polarization (X-Cr state $|S_z=+1,+1\rangle$), a splitting is observed in $\sigma-$ polarization in the PL of the two low energy lines produced by a second non-resonant laser.

	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Pictures/StarkSplitDet.png}

	\caption{(a) PL of X-Cr and configuration of excitation in the resonant optical control experiments.

(b) PL intensity maps of lines (5) and (4) for an excitation on (1) as a function of the detuning (top) and of the excitation intensity (bottom). The PL is produced by a second non-resonant laser.}
	\label{StarkSplitandDet}
	\end{figure}		

	The splitting measured on line (5) for a resonant excitation on line (1) is plotted as a function of the square root of the resonant laser intensity in Fig.~\ref{FitSplitDet} showing that, as expected for a two level system, it linearly depends on the laser field strength. The Rabi splitting can reach 150 $\mu eV$ at high excitation power. As the pump laser is detuned, the optically active transitions asymptotically approaches the original excitonic transitions where the remaining offset is the optical Stark shift.

The fit is obtained with $\hbar\Omega_r = 100$ $\mu$eV.}\label{FitSplitDet}}

	A resonant laser permits to address any spin state of the Cr and selectively shift its energy. For instance, as presented in Fig.~\ref{DarkExcSplit}, a $\sigma+$ excitation on the dark exciton state (5) induces a splitting of the high energy line (1) in $\sigma-$ polarization (state $|S_z=-1,-1\rangle$) without affecting the central line (2). This shows that such resonant excitation can be used to tune the energy of $S_z=-1$ without affecting $S_z=0$. The energy tuning induced by a coherent optical driving is particularly interesting for the control of the Cr spin states $S_z=\pm1$. These states could be efficiently mixed by applied weak anisotropic in-plane strain through a fine structure term of the form $E(S_x^2-S_y^2)$ \cite{LafuenteCrQD}. A relative shift of the energy of $S_z=+1$ or $S_z=-1$ by a resonant optical excitation would affect their coupling and consequently the Cr spin coherent dynamics.
