\chapter{Diluted magnetic semiconductor quantum dots\label{DMSQDTh}}


	This chapter aims to present the system we will study as well as the main theoretical tools one needs to understand it fully. We begin presenting the semiconductors, their electronic structure, and their interaction with light. We then see how the strains affect the picture we draw. We continue reducing the dimensions of the system we look at to get to one of the core of this thesis: the quantum dot (QD). We describe the effect of the confinement on the carrier, before seeing how they interact with each other inside the QD. We finish the section with the effect of the shape and strains anisotropy on the carriers and their emission.
	
	In the second section, we introduce the magnetic atom and see how they interact with the semiconductor carriers. We begin describing generally the interaction between localized electrons on the outer shell of a magnetic atom, and the one in the semiconductor. We then apply this description to the two magnetic atoms we will study in this thesis: the Manganese (Mn) and the Chromium (Cr).
	
	In the third section, we see how the insertion of the magnetic atom inside a lattice affects its electronic properties. We begin by describing the case of the Mn, not strongly coupled to the strain state at its position or the crystal field. We continue with the Cr, presenting an orbital momentum $L = 2$, making it strongly affected by the strains and the crystal field.
	
	We finish this chapter by an illustration, applying the different concept we saw to a simple system: an exciton coupled to a Mn atom in a neutral quantum.
	

	\section{II-VI semiconductor quantum dots}
	
	
	
 		\subsection{Band structure of CdTe and ZnTe\label{BandStruct}}
		
		CdTe and ZnTe are two II-VI semiconductors, meaning they are composed of an anion from the column VI of periodic table (Te), and a cation from the column II (Cd or Zn). They both crystallize in a zinc blend structure when grown in Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE, see 
		%Chap.~\ref{Growth}
		Chap.~II for more informations on this technique). As shown in Fig.~\ref{Zinc-Blende}, in this structure, each species is organized in a face centred lattice, one them being shift from the other by a quarter of the [111] diagonal. Each ion is then in a tetragonal environment, meaning the zinc-blende structure is of the $T_d$ space-group.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\caption{Zinc-blende crystal elementary cell. Both CdTe and ZnTe crystallize in this structure.\label{Zinc-Blende}}
	{\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=8cm]{01-QD/Pictures/ZincBlende-Wikipedia.png}
	\end{center}}
	\end{figure}

	The external orbitals are $s$ for the cation (4$d^{10}$5$s^2$ for Cd,  3$d^{10}$4$s^2$ for Zn) and $p$ for the anion (4$d^{10}$5$s^2$5$p^4$ for Te). Considering a N units crystal, it then contain 8N valence electrons, coming from the $s$ and $p$ levels of the ions. The $s$ and $p$ orbitals of these atoms hybridize to form 8 levels, 4 bonding and 4 anti-bonding.
	
	The lowest band of the bonding levels, coming from $s$ orbitals, will be filled by 2N valence electrons. 6N will be taken to fill the three bonding bands of higher energy, formed by the hybridization of $p$ orbitals. Those bonding states form the valence band. At higher energy, the anti-bonding states form the conduction band. Since all the available electrons are used to fill the valence band, the conduction band is empty in the ground state. The lower energy band of the conduction band is formed by the anti-symmetric combination of the $s$ orbitals. At higher energy, the anti-symmetric hybridization of $p$ orbitals form three other bands.

	The energy needed to promote one electron from the higher energy state of the valence band to the lower energy state of the conduction band is called the gap. In the ZnTe and CdTe cases, they are equal to $E_{g, ZnTe} = 2.40$ eV and  $E_{g, CdTe} = 1.60$ eV at 5K~\cite{FurdynaDMS}. It is possible to promote an electron from the valence band to the conduction band by injecting in the semiconductor at least as much energy as the size of the gap. The absence of an electron in the valence band can be viewed as a quasi-particle called a hole, with a spin and a charge opposed to the one of the promoted electron. An electron-hole pair form a hydrogen-like system called an exciton.
	
	When growing two semiconductors of different gap on top of each other, a band offset appear at the interface. This offset is distributed between the valence band and the conduction band. It creates traps for the carrier in those bands, confining them in the band of lower energy. For CdTe over ZnTe, the distribution of the offset is 5\% for the valence, 95\% for the conduction band. The confinement of the electron of the conduction band is thus far more efficient than confinement of the hole.

		\subsubsection*{Description around $k = 0$\label{k0Descr}}

	For CdTe, both the maximum of the valence band and the minimum of the conduction band are reached at the center of the Brillouin zone, at $k = 0$. It means CdTe is a direct band gap semi-conductor, and its optical properties are controlled by the symmetry at $k = 0$. At this point, the conduction has the $T_d$ group $\Gamma_6$ symmetry. As discussed, this band comes from the overlap of atomic $s$ orbitals, meaning the conduction electron will have no orbital momentum, and a total angular momentum $J = \dfrac{1}{2}$.
	
	The valence band is formed from $p$ orbitals, presenting a orbital momentum $L = 1$. It couples at $k = 0$ with the electron spin $S = \dfrac{1}{2}$ through the spin-orbit coupling, giving two sub-bands of total angular momentum $J = \dfrac{1}{2}$ and $J = \dfrac{3}{2}$. In the $T_d$ group, the quadruplet $J = \dfrac{3}{2}$ is of $\Gamma_8$ symmetry, and the doublet $J = \dfrac{1}{2}$ is of $\Gamma_7$ symmetry. Those bands are split by the spin-orbit interaction, with an energy $\Delta_{SO}$.
	
	When the spin-orbit coupling is introduced, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ are not good quantum number anymore. $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{L}+ \mathbf{S}$, however, commute with the system hamiltonian. Therefore, we chose the eigenstates $J^2$, $J_z$ as a basis for the system at $k = 0$. They can be deduced from the composition of the two uncoupled basis:
	\begin{align}	
		\Gamma_6&:
			\label{eBasis}
			\def\arraystretch{2.0}
			\begin{array}{lll}
				u_{\Gamma_6, \frac{1}{2}} &= |\dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{1}{2}\rangle &= |S\rangle|\uparrow\rangle \\
				u_{\Gamma_6, -\frac{1}{2}} &= |\dfrac{1}{2}, -\dfrac{1}{2}\rangle &= |S\rangle|\downarrow\rangle
			\end{array} \\
		\nonumber \\
		\Gamma_8&:
			\label{hBasis}
			\def\arraystretch{2.0}
			\begin{array}{lll}
				u_{\Gamma_8, \frac{3}{2}} &= |\dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{3}{2}\rangle &= |1\rangle|\uparrow\rangle \\
				u_{\Gamma_8, \frac{1}{2}} &= |\dfrac{3}{2}, \dfrac{1}{2}\rangle &= \sqrt{\dfrac{2}{3}}|0\rangle|\uparrow\rangle + \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{3}}|1\rangle|\downarrow\rangle \\	
				u_{\Gamma_8, -\frac{1}{2}} &= |\dfrac{3}{2}, -\dfrac{1}{2}\rangle &= \sqrt{\dfrac{2}{3}}|0\rangle|\downarrow\rangle + \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{3}}|1\rangle|\uparrow\rangle \\	
				u_{\Gamma_8, -\frac{3}{2}} &= |\dfrac{3}{2}, -\dfrac{3}{2}\rangle &= |-1\rangle|\downarrow\rangle \\	
			\end{array} \\
		\nonumber \\
		\Gamma_7&:
			\def\arraystretch{2.0}
			\begin{array}{ll}
				|\dfrac{1}{2}, \dfrac{1}{2}\rangle &= \sqrt{\dfrac{2}{3}}|1\rangle|\downarrow\rangle - \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{3}}|0\rangle|\uparrow\rangle \\
				|\dfrac{1}{2}, -\dfrac{1}{2}\rangle &= -\sqrt{\dfrac{2}{3}}|-1\rangle|\uparrow\rangle + \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{3}}|0\rangle|\downarrow\rangle
			\end{array}
	\end{align}
with:
	\begin{align*}
		|1\rangle &= -\frac{|X\rangle + i |Y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
		|0\rangle &= |Z\rangle \\
		|-1\rangle &= \frac{|X\rangle - i |Y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
	\end{align*}
where $|X\rangle$, $|Y\rangle$ and $|X\rangle$ are the wave function of the valence band top at $k = 0$. They are calculated from the overlap of the atomic orbital $p_X$, $p_Y$ and $p_Z$.

	
		Since $\Delta_{SO} \simeq 0.9$ eV in II-VI semiconductors, the $\Gamma_7$ band is far enough in the valence band to neglect its contribution to the system, and concentrate to the interaction between the $\Gamma_6$ and $\Gamma_8$ bands. The conduction band has a spin $\sigma = \frac{1}{2}$. The spin operator can therefore be written using the Pauli matrices. For a quantization along the growth axis of the semiconductor, noted $z$:
	\begin{align}
			\sigma_x = \dfrac{1}{2}
						\begin{pmatrix}
							0 & 1 \\
							1 & 0
						\end{pmatrix} \qquad ; \qquad
			\sigma_y = \dfrac{1}{2}
						\begin{pmatrix}
							0 & -i \\
							i & 0
						\end{pmatrix} \qquad ; \qquad
			\sigma_z = \dfrac{1}{2}
						\begin{pmatrix}
							1 & 0 \\
							0 & -1
						\end{pmatrix}
	\end{align}
In the same fashion, we can define the operators in the top of the valence band. For an angular momentum $J = \frac{3}{2}$ quantified along $z$, we have:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{ccl}
			J_x = \begin{pmatrix}
						0 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & 0 \\
						\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
						0 & 1 & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
						0 & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0
					\end{pmatrix} & ; &
			J_y = \begin{pmatrix}
						0 & -\frac{i\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & 0 \\
						\frac{i\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 & -i & 0 \\
						0 & i & 0 & -\frac{i\sqrt{3}}{2} \\
						0 & 0 & \frac{i\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0
					\end{pmatrix} \\
			& J_z = \begin{pmatrix}
						\frac{3}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\
						0 & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{3}{2}
					\end{pmatrix} &
		\end{array}
	\end{align}

Finally, for any spin operator $O$ ($O = \bm{\upsigma}$, $\mathbf{J}$ or any other angular momentum operator of this document), we can define the ladder operator, flipping the considered spin by one unit, such as $O_+|O\rangle \propto |O+1\rangle$ and $O_-|O\rangle \propto |O-1\rangle$. They read in the general case as:
	\begin{align}
		O_+ = O_x + iO_y \\
		O_- = O_x - iO_y
	\end{align}

	In a semiconductor, light matter interaction occurs mainly through two processes:  absorption of a photon of energy equal to or higher than the gap energy by an electron of the valence band to reach the conduction band, creating an exciton; or emission of photon by the recombination of an exciton. However, angular momentum conservation rules forbid some transitions. In order to find them, we consider the coupling between a conduction band electron $|\Psi_c\rangle$ and a valence band hole $|\Psi_v\rangle$ through the hamiltonian ${\cal H}_{AF} = -\frac{e}{m}\mathbf{p}.\mathbf{A}$, in the dipolar approximation. We get:
	\begin{align}
		\langle \Psi_v | {\cal H}_{AF} | \Psi_c \rangle \propto \langle u_{\Gamma_8, J_z} | \mathbf{p} | u_{\Gamma_6, \sigma_z} \rangle
	\end{align}
Considering that $|\uparrow\rangle$ and $|\downarrow\rangle$ are orthogonal states, we can easily deduce the authorize transitions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Between $| u_{\Gamma_6, \frac{1}{2}} \rangle$ and $| u_{\Gamma_8, \frac{3}{2}} \rangle$ (corresponding to a hole $J_z = -\frac{3}{2}$), an exciton of total angular momentum $X_z = -1$, coupled by $p_- = p_x - ip_y$, corresponding to a $\sigma-$ photon absorption or emission.
		\item Between $| u_{\Gamma_6, -\frac{1}{2}} \rangle$ and $| u_{\Gamma_8, -\frac{3}{2}} \rangle$ (corresponding to a hole $J_z = +\frac{3}{2}$), an exciton of total angular momentum $X_z = +1$, coupled by $p_+ = p_x + ip_y$, corresponding to a $\sigma+$ photon absorption or emission.
		\item Between $| u_{\Gamma_6, \frac{1}{2}} \rangle$ and $| u_{\Gamma_8, -\frac{1}{2}} \rangle$ (corresponding to a hole $J_z = \frac{1}{2}$) coupled via a $\sigma+$ photon absorption or emission.
		\item Between $| u_{\Gamma_6, -\frac{1}{2}} \rangle$ and $| u_{\Gamma_8, \frac{1}{2}} \rangle$ (corresponding to a hole $J_z = -\frac{1}{2}$) coupled via a $\sigma-$ photon absorption or emission.
		\item Between $| u_{\Gamma_6, \pm\frac{1}{2}} \rangle$ and $| u_{\Gamma_8, \mp\frac{1}{2}} \rangle$ coupled via a $\pi_z$ photon absorption or emission.
	\end{itemize}
Those transitions are summarize on Fig.~\ref{SelectionRules}, with their respective relative probability calculated from the oscillator strength of each of these transitions.

	\label{SelectionRules}
	\end{figure}

	Exciton of total angular momentum $J_z = \pm2$ also exists. They are formed by an electron of spin $\pm \dfrac{1}{2}$ coupled to a hole of spin $\pm \dfrac{3}{2}$. However, since this transition is forbidden by the conversation of angular momentum, they usually cannot recombine radiatively.

		\subsubsection*{$k \neq 0$: the $\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{p}$ approach}	
	
	The whole CdTe band structure is presented on Fig.~\ref{BandStruct}. One can note that CdTe is a direct gap semiconductor: the highest energy point of the valence band correspond to the lowest energy point of the conduction band, in $\Gamma$. Near the band edge, we can describe the curvature of the energy $E(\mathbf{k})$ of the band using an effective mass for the carrier on it:
	\begin{align}
		E_{\{c,v\}} (\mathbf{k}) = - \frac{(\hbar k)^2}{2m_{\{c,v\}}(\mathbf{k})}
	\end{align}		
	 As we move away from the $\Gamma$ point, the valence band into split two branches: the one with small curvature, meaning a high effective mass for the carriers on it, is called the heavy-hole (hh) band, while the one presenting the highest curvature and smallest effective mass is called the light-hole (lh) band.

		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{01-QD/Pictures/CdTeband.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{CdTe band structure}
	\label{BandStruct}
	\end{figure}

	One way to understand this evolution is to apply the $\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{p}$ approximation, as proposed by Kane in 1957~\cite{KaneBandkp}. This model gives an estimation of the electronic band structure starting from the exact solution and energy of the Schrödinger equation at the center of the Brillouin. The hamiltonian to resolve is then :	
	\begin{align}
		\label{SchrödEq}
		\left(\frac{p^2}{2m_0} + U(\mathbf{r})\right)|\psi_{n,\mathbf{k}}\rangle = E_{n,\mathbf{k}} |\psi_{n,\mathbf{k}}\rangle
	\end{align}
with $n$ the band index, $\mathbf{p} = -i\hbar\mathbf{\nabla}$ $U(\mathbf{r})$ the potential of the crystal, $m_0$ the mass of a free carrier and $|\psi_{n,\mathbf{k}}\rangle$ the Bloch wave, separated between a periodic part $u_{n,\mathbf{k}} (\mathbf{r})$ and plane-wave part $\exp(i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})$ as follow :
	\begin{align}
		|\psi_{n,\mathbf{k}}\rangle = u_{n,\mathbf{k}} (\mathbf{r}) \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})
	\end{align}
Writing the wavefunction this way make it possible to rewrite the equation \ref{SchrödEq} as a function of the periodic part only, after development of the gradient of $\psi_{n, \mathbf{k}}$. It became:
	\begin{align}
		\label{kpHamil}
		\left(\frac{p^2}{2m_0} + U(\mathbf{r}) + \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0} + \frac{\hbar}{m_0}\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{p}\right)u_{n,\mathbf{k}} = E_{n,\mathbf{k}} u_{n,\mathbf{k}}
	\end{align}
	
	To search the solutions around $k = 0$, we develop the $u_{n,\mathbf{k}}$ on the basis of the $\{u_{n,0}\}_n$ as:
	\begin{align*}
		u_{n,\mathbf{k}} = \sum_{n'} c_{n'} u_{n',0}
	\end{align*}
Assuming we know the $u_{n,0}$, we can then calculate the matrix elements of Eq.~\ref{kpHamil}.
The resolution of this hamiltonian is often done in the books, and gives, taking into account the $\Gamma_6$ and $\Gamma_8$ bands only:

	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{l}
		E_c (k_z) = E_c + \dfrac{\hbar^2 k_z^2}{2m_c} \\
		E_{v, \pm\frac{1}{2}} (k_z) = E_v - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k_z^2}{2m_{lh}} \\
		E_{v, \pm\frac{3}{2}} (k_z) = E_v + \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2_z}{2m_{0}}
		\end{array}	
	\end{align}
with $E_c$ (respectively, $E_v$) the energy of the conduction band (respectively, the valence band), $m_c$ the effective mass of the carrier in the conduction band and $m_{lh}$ the effective mass of the light hole. One can see that the splitting of the valence band separate the carrier with a spin $J_z = \pm \frac{3}{2}$ (hh) from the one with a spin $J_z = \pm \frac{1}{2}$ (lh). However, neglecting the bands other than $\Gamma_6$ and $\Gamma_8$ leads to a positive curvature for the hh. To correct this problem, we would have to take into account higher energies conduction bands, which will repel the hh band and give it its negative curvature.

		\subsubsection*{$k \neq 0$: the Luttinger hamiltonian}

	Another solution to have the matrix describing the $\Gamma_8$ band is to use symmetry consideration. Luttinger showed in 1956~\cite{LuttingerHam} that the only Hamiltonian fulfilling the cubic symmetry is:
	\begin{align}
	\label{LuttHamil}
		{\cal H}_L = - \frac{h^2}{2m_0}\left(\gamma_1 k^2 I_4 - 2 \gamma_2 \sum_i k_i^2 \left(J_i^2 - \frac{1}{3} J^2\right) - 2 \gamma_3 (k_x k_y (J_x J_y + J_y J_x) + c.p.) \right)
	\end{align}
with $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$ the Luttinger parameters, $I_4$ the 4 $\times$ 4 identity matrix, $\mathbf{k}$ a vector of the Brillouin zone, $\mathbf{J}$ the angular momentum operator with $J_x$, $J_y$ and $J_z$ being 4 $\times$ 4 matric satisfying $[J_x, J_y] = iJ_z$ and circular permutation ($c.p$). 
	This hamiltonian can be simplified using the parameters:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{l}
			A = \gamma_1 + \dfrac{5}{2} \gamma_2 \\
			B = 2 \gamma_2 \\
			C = 2(\gamma_3 - \gamma_2)
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
The Luttinger hamiltonian can then be rewritten:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_L = - \frac{h^2}{2m_0}(Ak^2 I_4 - B(\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{J})^2 + C(k_x k_y (J_x J_y + J_y J_x) + c.p.))
	\end{align}
The $B$-term lifts the degeneracy of the $\Gamma_8$ band into two sub-bands as shown above, and is invariant under arbitrary rotations. The $C$-term describes the warping of the valence band.

	In the spherical approximation, the Luttinger hamiltonian has two eigenvalues, giving us the value of the lh and hh effective mass:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{l}
			E_{hh} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0 (A-2.25B)^{-1}} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0 (\gamma_1 - 2 \gamma_2 )^{-1}} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_{hh}} \\
			E_{lh} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0 (A-0.25B)^{-1}} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0 (\gamma_1 + 2 \gamma_2 )^{-1}} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_{lh}}
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
As expected from the band structure, the hh presents a negative curvature.

	The parameters and carriers effective masses are given in the Tab.~\ref{Param}.

	The Luttinger hamiltonian is usually written in matrix form. In the ($u_{\Gamma_8, +\frac{3}{2}}$, $u_{\Gamma_8, +\frac{1}{2}}$, $u_{\Gamma_8, -\frac{1}{2}}$, $u_{\Gamma_8, -\frac{3}{2}}$) basis, we can rewrite it:

		c_{Lutt} &= - \sqrt{3}(\gamma_2 (k_x^2 - k_y^2) - 2i\gamma_3k_xk_y)
	\end{align*}


		\subsection{Lattice mismatch and the Bir-Pikus Hamiltonian \label{BPSec}}
		
	ZnTe crystal has a lattice parameter of $a_{ZnTe} = $ 6.10 \AA, while CdTe one is of $a_{CdTe} = $ 6.48 \AA. This lattice mismatch results in strain in a CdTe layer grown on a ZnTe substrate:
		\begin{align}
			\varepsilon_{\parallel} = \frac{a_{ZnTe} - a_{CdTe}}{a_{CdTe}} = -5.8\%
		\end{align}
		
		In order to represent this strain and see its effects on the bands, we need to define a hamiltonian representing them. Strains deform the structure, so let's begin the representation with an volume $V = x\mathbf{u_x} + y\mathbf{u_y} + z\mathbf{u_z}$, with $(\mathbf{u_x}, \mathbf{u_y}, \mathbf{u_z})$ an orthonormal basis. This volume will transform into another one $V' = x\mathbf{u_x'} + y\mathbf{u_y'} + z\mathbf{u_z'}$, where:
		\begin{align}
			\begin{array}{l}							
				\mathbf{u_x'} = (1 + \varepsilon_{xx}')\mathbf{u_x} + \varepsilon_{xy}' \mathbf{u_y} + \varepsilon_{xz}' \mathbf{u_z} \\
				\mathbf{u_y'} = \varepsilon_{yx}' \mathbf{u_x} + (1 + \varepsilon_{yy}')\mathbf{u_y} + \varepsilon_{yz}' \mathbf{u_z} \\
				\mathbf{u_z'} = \varepsilon_{zx}' \mathbf{u_x} + \varepsilon_{zy}' \mathbf{u_y} + (1 + \varepsilon_{zz}')\mathbf{u_z}
			\end{array}
		\end{align}
		
	$\varepsilon_{ij}'$ represents an expansion of the vector $i$ in the direction $j$. They are small deformation of the lattice, so we choose $|\varepsilon_{ij}'| \ll 1$. Such transformation can be decomposed in a symmetric part, the strain tensor, and an antisymetric one. We note the strain tensor $\overline{\overline{\varepsilon}}$, defined such as:
	\begin{align}
		\varepsilon_{ ii} &= \varepsilon_{ii}' \\
		\varepsilon_{ij} &= \frac{1}{2} \left(\varepsilon_{ij}' + \varepsilon_{ji}'\right)
	\end{align}

	In the linear regime, the strain tensor $\overline{\overline{\varepsilon}}$ is proportional to the stress tensor $\overline{\overline{\sigma}}$, where $\sigma_{ij}$ describe a force parallel to $i$ applied on a surface perpendicular to $j$. Therefore, $\sigma_{ii}$ will describe an elongation or compression stress, while $\sigma_{ij}$ ($i\neq j$) represents a shear stress. Since these tensor are symmetric, we can reduce the number of coefficient from nine to six: $\sigma_{xx}$, $\sigma_{yy}$, $\sigma_{zz}$, $\sigma_{xy} = \sigma_{yx}$, $\sigma_{xz} = \sigma_{zx}$ and $\sigma_{yz} = \sigma_{zy}$. Therefore, in the linear regime and for a cubic crystal, we can write the Hooke's law:
	\begin{align}
	\label{HookeLaw}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\sigma_{xx} \\
			\sigma_{yy} \\
			\sigma_{zz} \\
			\sigma_{xy} \\
			\sigma_{xz} \\
			\sigma_{yz}
		\end{bmatrix}
		=
		\begin{bmatrix}
			C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
			C_{12} & C_{11} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
			C_{12} & C_{12} & C_{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
			0 & 0 & 0 & 2C_{44} & 0 & 0 \\
			0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2C_{44} & 0 \\
			0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2C_{44}
		\end{bmatrix}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\varepsilon_{xx} \\
			\varepsilon_{yy} \\
			\varepsilon_{zz} \\
			\varepsilon_{xy} \\
			\varepsilon_{xz} \\
			\varepsilon_{yz}
		\end{bmatrix}
	\end{align}
Since $x$, $y$ and $z$ are physically equivalent, as well as $xy$, $xz$ and $yz$, only two diagonal coefficient are needed, $C_{11}$ and $C_{44}$. These coefficient coupling strains in a direction to a force in the same direction are obviously positives.

	When the considered cube is compressed in one direction (e.g. $\varepsilon_{zz} < 0$), it will expand in the other direction in order to minimize elastic energy ($\varepsilon_{xx}$, $\varepsilon_{yy} > 0$ in the example). If we don't allow strain in these other directions ($\varepsilon_{xx} = \varepsilon_{yy} = 0$), a stress in the x and y directions had to be applied to keep the cube from expanding in these directions ($\sigma_{xx}$, $\sigma_{yy} < 0$ in the example). We can therefore physically expect $C_{12} > 0$.
	
	The strain hamiltonian can be constructed noticing that the strain tensor $\overline{\overline{\varepsilon}}$ induces a shift in the bands energy, and that any $\varepsilon_{ij}$ has the same symmetry as $k_i k_j$. The hamiltonian should then be formarly identical to the Luttinger hamiltonian. In the $\Gamma_8$ subspace, we can then use the Luttinger Hamiltonian, written in Eq.~\ref{LuttHamil}, replacing the $k_i k_j$ by $\varepsilon_{ij}$. We obtain the Bir-Pikus Hamiltonian by replacing the $\gamma_j$ parameters by the Bir-Pikus parameters $a_{\nu}$, $b$ and $d$ for the four levels at the top of the valence band~\cite{kpMethod}:
	\begin{align}
	\label{BPHamil}
		{\cal H}_{BP} = a_{\nu} \sum_i \varepsilon_{ii} + b \sum_i \varepsilon_{ii} \left(J_i^2 - \frac{1}{3}J^2\right) + \frac{2d}{\sqrt{3}} \sum_{i>j} \varepsilon_{ij} \{J_i J_j\}
	\end{align}
with $\varepsilon = Tr(\overline{\overline{\varepsilon}}) = \varepsilon_{xx} + \varepsilon_{yy}+ \varepsilon_{zz}$ and $\{J_i J_j\} = \frac{1}{2}(J_iJ_j + J_jJ_i)$

	The $a_{\nu}$ term, called the hydrostatic term, shifts the $\Gamma_8$ energy. In case of non-equal $\varepsilon_{ii}$ (shear strains), the $b$ term will split the two $\Gamma_8$ sub-bands as did a $k\neq 0$ in the Luttinger hamiltonian. The $d$ term, the pure shear strain (i.e $\varepsilon_{ij}$ with $i \neq j$), has the same effect on the $\Gamma_8$ band.
	
	One can notice that the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian is completely independant from $\mathbf{k}$, meaning that the valence band hamiltonian of a strain semiconductor is simply the sum of the Luttinger hamiltonian ${\cal H}_L$ (Eq.~\ref{LuttHamil}) and the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian ${\cal H}_{BP}$ (Eq.~\ref{BPHamil}).
	
	Let see how this apply to a CdTe layer deposited on a ZnTe layer. As previously, we define $z$ as the growth direction. As shown at the begin of this part, CdTe and ZnTe have a lattice mismatch of 5.8\%. Since both crystallize in a cubic lattice, the strains are the same in the $x$ and $y$ direction. We can then write the strains in the $xy$ plane:
	\begin{align}
	\label{epsperp}
		\varepsilon_{xx} = \varepsilon_{yy} = \varepsilon_{\parallel} = \frac{a_{ZnTe} - a_{CdTe}}{a_{CdTe}}
	\end{align}
In the $z$ direction, however, no stress applies: the crystal is free to expand in this direction in order to reduce the elastic energy. Therefore, we can write $\sigma_{zz} = 0$ and, according to Hooke's law in Eq.~\ref{HookeLaw}:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			\sigma_{zz} &= C_{12} \varepsilon_{xx} + C_{12} \varepsilon_{yy} + C_{11} \varepsilon_{zz} \\
						&= 0
		\end{array}		
	\end{align}
Using equality \ref{epsperp}, we can then deduce:
	\begin{align}
	\label{epsz}
		\varepsilon_{zz} = - \frac{2C_{12}}{C_{11}} \varepsilon_{\parallel} = - \frac{2C_{12}}{C_{11}} \frac{a_{ZnTe} - a_{CdTe}}{a_{CdTe}}
	\end{align}
	
	Since we grow CdTe over a ZnTe substrate, the CdTe lattice is compressed in the plane, i.e. $\varepsilon_{\parallel} < 0$. Since $C_{11}$, $C_{12} > 0$ and $\varepsilon_{\parallel} < 0$ for CdTe over ZnTe (see Eq.~\ref{epsperp}), one can easily deduce that $\varepsilon_{zz} > 0$. In the hypothesis of no defect created by the lattice mismatch, all the other strain terms are equal to zero. We can then decompose this strain into two component: a hydrostatic part describing the volume variation without breaking the cubic symmetry, and a shear part introducing an anisotropy, breaking this symmetry:
	\begin{align}
		\overline{\overline{\varepsilon_{hyd}}} &= \frac{1}{3}(\varepsilon_{xx} + \varepsilon_{yy} + \varepsilon_{zz})I_3 \\
		\overline{\overline{\varepsilon_{sh}}} &= \overline{\overline{\varepsilon}} - \overline{\overline{\varepsilon_{hyd}}}
	\end{align}
	
	One can notice that $Tr(\overline{\overline{\varepsilon_{hyd}}}) = Tr(\overline{\overline{\varepsilon}}) = \varepsilon$. Since in the case of a hydrostatic compression, such as what is the case with CdTe over ZnTe, $\varepsilon_{hyd} < 0$, we then have $\varepsilon < 0$ and, according to the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian (Eq.~\ref{BPHamil}), the gap of CdTe increase. For CdTe, Bir-Pikus parameter are $a_{\nu} = 0.91$ eV, $b = 1.0$ eV and $d = 4.4$ eV~\cite{CdTeBPCoef}.
	
	Seeing that $\varepsilon_{ij} = 0$ for $i\neq j$, we can rewrite the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian without the shear strain term. Moreover, since $J^2 = J_x^2 + J_y^2 + J_z^2$ and that $\varepsilon_{xx} = \varepsilon_{yy} = \varepsilon_{\parallel}$, we can simplify this hamiltonian to:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{BP, biax} = a_{\nu} \varepsilon I_4 + \frac{b}{3}(\varepsilon_{\parallel} - \varepsilon_{zz})(J_x^2 + J_y^2 - 2 J_z^2)
	\end{align}
And, since we are in the valence band with $J = \frac{3}{2}$ and $J_x^2 + J_y^2 + J_z^2 = J(J+1)I_4$, we can simplify the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian to its final form in the case of biaxal strains:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{BP, biax} = \left(a_{\nu} \varepsilon + \frac{5}{4} b (\varepsilon_{\parallel} - \varepsilon_{zz})\right)I_4 - b (\varepsilon_{\parallel} - \varepsilon_{zz})J_z^2
	\end{align}
	
	Using Eq.~\ref{epsperp} and \ref{epsz}, we can easily calculate $\varepsilon_{\parallel} - \varepsilon_{zz}$. Since $J_z|n\rangle = n|n\rangle$, we can find the hh/lh splitting:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			\Delta_{lh} = E_{\pm \frac{3}{2}} - E_{\pm \frac{1}{2}} &= - 2b \left(1 + \dfrac{2C_{12}}{C_{11}} \right) \dfrac{a_{ZnTe} - a_{CdTe}}{a_{CdTe}} \\
													&= 2b \left(1 + \dfrac{2C_{12}}{C_{11}} \right) \dfrac{a_{CdTe} - a_{ZnTe}}{a_{CdTe}}
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
We find that, in a fully strained CdTe layer over a ZnTe substrate, the hh band is 300 meV above the lh one, and we will thus neglect them in the next sections. However, more complex effects can also be included in $\Delta_{lh}$, such as a coupling of the confined heavy hole with ground state light holes in the barriers~\cite{Couplinghhlhbarrier}, or the the effective reduction of hh/lh splitting due to supercoupling via a dense manifold of hh like QD states lying between the confined heavy hole and light hole levels~\cite{Supercouplinghhlh}. These effects can drastically change the hh/lh splitting.

		\subsection{3D confinement: the quantum dot\label{e-hIntQD}}
		
		Embedding a semiconductor in another one of larger gap creates trap for carriers, confining them in one or multiple directions. CdTe conduction band is at a lower energy than ZnTe ones, creating such a trap. Using the procedure we will describe in 
		%Chap.~\ref{Growth}
		Chap.~II, we can create nanometre size island of CdTe in a ZnTe lattice, effectively confining electrons in all three directions, acting like a 3D trap for the free carriers. This lead to a quantization of the carriers energy levels and a discretization of the optical properties. This confinement being analogue to the Coulomb interaction of an isolated atom, such a structure is often dubbed "artificial atom". However, the interaction between the hole and the electron cannot be overlook, adding to this potential the Coulomb interaction between the particule and the quasi-particule. It consists of an attractive term, shifting energy levels, and an exchange interaction (discussed in Sec.~\ref{ehExch}). Moreover, the hole being the absence of an electron, its energy, charge, spin, orbital momentum, $\mathbf{k}$ and mass are, by definition, opposite to the missing electron. The electron-hole system has a hydrogen-like behaviour and is called an exciton.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\fcapside{\caption{AFM image (AFM image (250 nm $\times$ 250 nm) of CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots before caping. The dot density is estimated to be in the $10^{10}$ dots.cm$^{-2}$ range.}\label{AFM}}
	{\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=8cm]{01-QD/Pictures/AFMQD.eps}
	\end{center}}
	\end{figure}

	The effects of confinement on the carrier are easier to describe in the envelop function formalism. To define these envelop functions, we develop the carriers wave-functions on all the Bloch states:
	\begin{align}
		\Psi (\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{n,\mathbf{k}} c_{n,\mathbf{k}} \psi_{n,\mathbf{k}} = \sum_{n,\mathbf{k}} c_{n,\mathbf{k}} u _{n,\mathbf{k}} (\mathbf{r}) \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})
	\end{align}
Since we are in a confined environment, we can consider only the states around $\mathbf{k} = 0$. Since we consider the band extrema, we neglect for this part the inter-band wave function mixing and use the effective-mass approximation. We can then limit the expansion of Bloch state to an expansion on the $u _{n,0} (\mathbf{r}) \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})$, with $n = \Gamma_6$ for the conduction band and $n = \Gamma_8$ for the valence. We can then write:
	\begin{align}
		\Psi_c (\mathbf{r}) & \simeq \sum_{\mathbf{k}} c_{\mathbf{k}} u _{\Gamma_6,0} (\mathbf{r}) \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r}) = F_e (\mathbf{r}) u _{\Gamma_6,0} \label{eEnvFunc} \\		
		\Psi_v (\mathbf{r}) & \simeq \sum_{J_z = \{\pm \frac{3}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{2}\}, k} c_{J_z,\mathbf{k}} u _{\Gamma_8,J_z} (\mathbf{r}) \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})  = \sum_{J_z = \{\pm \frac{3}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{2}\}} F_{J_z} (\mathbf{r}) u _{\Gamma_8,J_z} \label{hEnvFunc}
	\end{align}
with $F_e (\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} c_{\mathbf{k}} \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})$ the electron envelop function and $F_{J_z} (\mathbf{r}) = c_{J_z,\mathbf{k}} \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})$, $J_z = \{\pm \frac{3}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{2}\}$ the hole envelop functions.

	The effective mass approximation allows us to replace the periodic crystal potential and the free-electron kinetic energy by the effective Hamiltonian representing the band extrema, using $m_e$ for the conduction band 
and ${\cal H}_L + {\cal H}_{BP}$ for the top of the valence band. Considering the effective mass is the same in CdTe and ZnTe, we can now work with the simple picture of an effective mass carrier with the envelop function defined in Eqs.~\ref{eEnvFunc} and \ref{hEnvFunc}, trapped in a potential $V_e (\mathbf{r})$ for the conduction band or $V_h (\mathbf{r})$ for the valence band, created by the band offset between the two semiconductors. We write the Schrödinger equations for these particles:
	\begin{align}
		\left(\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\Delta \right)F_e (\mathbf{r}) + V_e (\mathbf{r}) F_e (\mathbf{r}) &= E_eF_e (\mathbf{r}) \label{eSchroding} \\
		(\tilde{{\cal H}}_L + \tilde{{\cal H}}_{BP} + V_h (\mathbf{r})) 
			\begin{pmatrix}
				F_{+ \frac{3}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) \\
				F_{+ \frac{1}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) \\
				F_{- \frac{1}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) \\
				F_{- \frac{3}{2}} (\mathbf{r})
			\end{pmatrix}
			&= E_h
			\begin{pmatrix}
				F_{+ \frac{3}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) \\
				F_{+ \frac{1}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) \\
				F_{- \frac{1}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) \\
				F_{- \frac{3}{2}} (\mathbf{r})
			\end{pmatrix}
			\label{hSchroding}
	\end{align}
with $\tilde{{\cal H}}_L$ and $\tilde{{\cal H}}_{BP}$ the hole hamiltonians, opposite to the electron hamiltonians defined in Eq.~\ref{LuttHamil} and \ref{BPHamil}. In $\tilde{{\cal H}}_L$, the $k$-terms transform into a gradient of the envelop function with the form $i\nabla$. For simplicity, the $\tilde{}$ will be dropped in the next equations. The derivation of the effective mass approximation can be found in reference \cite{LuttElecMotion}.

	As pointed out in the end of Sec.~\ref{BPSec}, the gap between lh and hh is wide enough to neglect lh contribution in first approximation. This is called the heavy hole approximation, uncoupling the four differential equations defined in Eq.~\ref{hSchroding}. Only the ground states $|\pm \frac{3}{2}\rangle$ are considered, with the effective mass given by the diagonal term of ${\cal H}_{L}$, noted $m_{h, \parallel}$ in the plane and $m_{h, z}$ along the growth axis. The spin operator $J_x$, $J_y$ and $J_z$ can then be redefined in the heavy-hole space as $j_x$, $j_y$, $j_z$, written with the Pauli matrix looking like $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$ and $\sigma_z$.
	
	Even with those two approximations, this problem is still unsolvable analytically. However, it is possible for some chosen potentials. Let's consider a lens like quantum dot, with a radius in the $xy$ plane, noted $\rho$, much larger than its height $L_z$. We can therefore define two different harmonic oscillators: a 2D oscillator $V_{c,v} (\rho)$ in the plane, and a 1D oscillator $V_{c,v} (z)$ along the growth axis:
	\begin{align}
		V_{c,v} (\rho) = 4 \Delta E_{c,v} \frac{\rho ^2}{L_z^2} \\
		V_{c,v} (z) = 4 \Delta E_{c,v} \frac{z^2}{L_z^2}
	\end{align}
with $\Delta E_{c,v}$ the difference of conduction (resp. valence) band energy between the two semiconductors. The potential of the whole quantum dot will the be $V_{c,v} (\mathbf{r}) = V_{c,v} (\rho) + V_{c,v} (z)$. Separating the potential in those two parts means we are searching for solution of the form $F(z, \rho, \theta) = \chi (z) \phi_{n,m} (\rho, \theta)$, with $\theta$ the angle between the position vector and the $x$ axis.

	We write the characteristic spatial width $\sigma$ and characteristic frequency $\omega$ of the 2D harmonic oscillator felt by the hole:
	\begin{align}
		\Sigma_{\rho}^h &= \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m_{h, \parallel} \omega_{\rho}^{h}}} \\
		\omega_{\rho}^{h} &= \sqrt{\frac{8\Delta E_{v}}{m_{h, \parallel} L_{\rho}^2}}
	\end{align}
We can write the same equality along $z$ replacing $\rho$ by $z$ and $m_{h, \parallel}$ by $m_{h,z}$. The same can be done for electron, replacing the  $m_{h, \parallel}$ or $m_{h,z}$ by $m_e$ and $E_v$ by $E_c$.

	We can find in textbook such as ref.~\cite{MecQBasvant} the solution of a harmonic oscillator from which we can deduce the solution for the ground state (GS) and the first two degenerated excited states. The first excited state is found to have an angular momentum $l_z = \pm 1$, and is then noted $Exc, \pm 1$. The envelop functions and energy are then found to be:
	\begin{align}
			& F_{c,v}^{GS} (z, \rho, \theta) = \frac{1}{(\sqrt{\pi}\Sigma_z)^{\frac{1}{2}}} \exp \left(- \frac{z^2}{2 \Sigma_z^2}\right) \frac{1}{(\sqrt{\pi}\Sigma_{\rho})^{\frac{1}{2}}} \exp \left(- \frac{\rho^2}{2 \Sigma_{\rho}^2}\right) \label{GSWF} \\
			& E_{e,h}^{GS} = \hbar \frac{\omega_z^{e,h} + \omega_{\rho}^{e,h}}{2} \\
		\nonumber \\
			& F_{c,v}^{Exc, \pm 1} (z, \rho, \theta) = \frac{1}{(\sqrt{\pi}\Sigma_z)^{\frac{1}{2}}} \exp \left(- \frac{z^2}{2 \Sigma_z^2}\right) \frac{1}{(\sqrt{\pi}\Sigma_{\rho})^{\frac{1}{2}}} \exp \left(- \frac{\rho^2}{2 \Sigma_{\rho}^2}\right) \frac{\rho}{\sigma_{\rho}} \exp (\pm i\theta) \label{ExcWF} \\
			& E_{e,h}^{Exc, \pm 1} = \hbar \frac{\omega_z^{e,h} + 3 \omega_{\rho}^{e,h}}{2}
	\end{align}
We see that these energy levels are quantified in a way looking like an isolated atom, as pointed earlier. In reference to the atomic notation, the ground state, lower energy level, is noted $S$ and the two first degenerated level are noted $P$, even though atomic p-states usually are 3 fold degenerated.

	One remarkable feature of the envelop functions is that both GS and the two first excited states present the same envelop along the $z$ axis. The cause is directly the symmetry of the QD: since $L_z \ll L_{\rho}$, $\omega_z^{e,h} \gg \omega_{\rho}^{e,h}$, and since $E_{osc.\ harmo.} = (n+\frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega$, the next possible envelop function along the $z$ axis is at higher energy than the next one in the plane. This geometry is also responsible for the 2 fold degeneracy of the $P$-states.
	
	Both the GS and the excited states are once again degenerated due to the spin of the electron and the hole. The electron is in the conduction band with the $\Gamma_6$ symmetry: it can then take the value $\sigma_z = \pm \frac{1}{2}$ (noted $|\uparrow\rangle$ for $+\frac{1}{2}$ and $|\downarrow\rangle$ for $-\frac{1}{2}$). Since we are in the hh approximation, considering the lh are far enough from the band edge to be negligible, the hole spin can only take the values $J_z = \pm \frac{3}{2}$ (noted $|\Uparrow\rangle$ for $+\frac{3}{2}$ and $|\Downarrow\rangle$ for $-\frac{3}{2}$). As pointed ahead, the hole is defined with the opposed characteristic of the missing electron. For instance, a hole $|\Downarrow\rangle$ corresponds to the absence of a valence electron $\Psi_v (\mathbf{r}) = u_{\Gamma_8, \frac{3}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) F_{\frac{3}{2}} (\mathbf{r})$.
	
	The confinement alone does not change the recombination rules we discussed in Sec.~\ref{k0Descr}. The addition of envelop functions in the carriers wave function adds another selection term:
	\begin{align}
		|\langle \Psi_v | \mathbf{p} | \Psi_c \rangle |^2 = |\langle F_v | F_c \rangle |^2|\langle u_{\Gamma_8, J_z} | \mathbf{p} | u_{\Gamma_6, \sigma_z} \rangle |^2
	\end{align}
The first term is the overlap of the envelop function, making sure the hole and the electron are of the right state: a transition between a $P$ state of the valence band and a $S$ state in the conduction band is then forbidden. The second term is the same as the one studied earlier, and from which we deduced the selection rules.

	
	Approximating the QD potential as harmonic usually overestimate the confinement, and thus the single-particle energy. But the wave-functions found in this chapter can still be used as trial wave-functions for variational calculations in other potential, in order to estimate the correct energy level.
	

		\subsection{Electron-hole exchange in quantum dots\label{ehExch}}
		













	%Bir et Pikus: l'interaction d'échange de coulomb de l'électron CB and les électrons VB peut être séparés en deux terme : un short range et un long range.
	
	Electrons are fermions, and thus are subjected to the Pauli exclusion principle. Being charged particles, they also interact with each other via the Coulomb interaction. Both of those have to be considered to write the interaction between the carriers in the semiconductor. It was shown by Wardzyński et al.~\cite{ExchSplitInteratomic} that the interaction between a conduction electron and all the electrons of the valence band can be written as an interaction between the considered electron and the corresponding hole. It can separated into two term: the direct Coulomb interaction and the exchange Coulomb interaction.
	
	
	In exciton, the direct Coulomb term is attractive, as classically expected from an electric interaction between two opposite charges. However, more complex systems can exist in a semiconductor: charged excitons X$^+$ (hole-hole-electron complex) and X$^-$ (hole-electron-electron complex), or biexciton X$^2$ (two excitons of opposite total angular momentum). Higher order multi-excition or charged biexciton might also exists but they are not discussed in this thesis. For such complex, the direct Coulomb interaction might become attractive for two charges of same sign.

	Taking into account the symmetry of the crystal, Bir and Pikus demonstrated~\cite{BPExchInt} that the exchange hamiltonian between an electron of the conduction band and hole in the valence band can be decomposed in two different components:\newline
	For an electron and a hole in the same Brillouin zone, the short-range exchange interaction is to be considered. It can be written:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{eh}^{sr} = I_{eh}^{sr} \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{j} + \sum_{i = x,y,z} b_i^{exch} \sigma_i j_i^3
	\end{align}
The first term lift the degeneracy between exciton of total angular moment $X=2$ and $X=1$. The second one take into account the reduction of symmetry in a cubic lattice and gives the dark states a fine structure. This have never been observed experimentally in bulk semiconductor, but it is expected to be much smaller than the lift induced by $I_{eh}^{sr}$.\newline
	For carriers in different Brillouin-zone, the long-range exchange interaction have to be considered. In bulk semiconductors, the long range term doesn't affect the bright exciton at $k = 0$. Since the radiative recombination we study occurs at $k=0$, the long range interaction does not affect it.
	
	In a quantum dot, the confinement of the carrier leads to a better overlap of the wave function and thus greater short range exchange energies. Moreover, in an anisotropic potential, such as the one of Stransky-Krastanov dots (see Chap.~II.1), the long-range interaction mixes the bright exciton, splitting them in two levels. 
	%The splitting between the dark and bright excitons is thus also affected.
Taking into account all these effect, we can the write the total hamiltonian in the heavy hole exciton subspace ($X_z = |+2\rangle$, $|+1\rangle$, $|-1\rangle$, $|-2\rangle$):
	\begin{align}
	\label{Heh}
		{\cal H}_{eh} &=
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\delta_0 & 0 & 0 & \delta_2 \\
			0 & - \delta_0 & \frac{1}{2} \delta_1 \exp(-2i \phi_1) & 0 \\
			0 & \frac{1}{2} \delta_1 \exp(-2i \phi_1) & -\delta_0 & 0 \\
			\delta_2 & 0 & 0 & \delta_0
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{align}
with $\delta_0 = \frac{3}{2}I_{eh}$ representing the splitting between dark and bright exciton, $\delta_1$ the splitting between the bright exciton states and $\delta_2$ the dark exciton states fine structure. $\delta_0$ value is controlled both by long-range and short-range interaction, and is typically of about 1 meV in CdTe/ZnTe. $\delta_1$ only appear in anisotropic quantum dot and is induced by the long-range interaction, varying between a few tens and a few hundreds of $\mu$eV. Finally, $\delta_2$ primarily arise from the short-range interaction.

	
	Calculating the eigenstate of the hamiltonian \ref{Heh}, we find that the optically active states are linearly polarized along $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_1 + 90^{\circ}$ as followed:
	\begin{align}
		|\pi_{\varphi_1}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\exp(-i\varphi_1)|+1\rangle + \exp(i\varphi_1)|-1\rangle\right) \\
		|\pi_{\varphi_1 + 90^{\circ}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left(\exp(-i\varphi_1)|+1\rangle - \exp(i\varphi_1)|-1\rangle\right)
	\end{align}
In order to get a polarization of the emission along the 110 axis, we choose $\varphi_1 = \dfrac{\pi}{4}$.

	This model works well for quantum dots with an elongated lens shape ($C_{2v}$ symmetry).  However, more realistic self-assembled quantum dots have symmetries which can deviate quite substantially from the idealized shapes of circular or ellipsoidal lenses. For a $C_{s}$ symmetry (truncated ellipsoidal lens), additional terms coupling the dark and the bright excitons have to be included in the electron-hole exchange Hamiltonian. Following Ref. \cite{ZielinskiDarExc}, the general form of the electron-hole exchange Hamiltonian in the heavy-hole exciton basis for a low symmetry quantum dot (C$_s$) is
	\begin{align}
		\label{HehCs}
		\mathcal{H}_{eh} =\frac{1}{2} \left(
			\begin{array}{cccc}

		\subsection{Valence band mixing\label{VBM}}	
	
	The long range exchange interaction split the neutral exciton bright states in two linearly polarized lines, with a $90^{\circ}$ angle between them. However, this simple picture doesn't fit well with the data, such as presented in Fig.~\ref{XAlLinPol}. For once, it is clear for the neutral species ($X$, $X^2$) that the angle between the polarization of the two lines is different from $90^{\circ}$. Moreover, the charged species ($X^+$, $X^-$) are found to present linear polarization dependency, when the presence of the second hole ($X^+$) or electron ($X^-$) with an opposite spin should compensate the exciton exchange interaction, and thus these system should not present any dependency in linear polarization.

	\label{XAlLinPol}
	\end{figure}
	
	In order to fully understand it dependency, we have to stop neglecting the light hole contribution. Looking at the general form of the Luttinger hamiltonian \ref{HLMat}, we see that it mixes heavy hole and light hole through its non-diagonal term $b_{Lutt}$ and $c_{Lutt}$. The Bir-Pikus hamiltonian \ref{BPHamil} presents the same symmetry and the same form as the Luttinger hamiltonian and thus also induces a coupling between the lh states and the hh states. In general, we can write the hamiltonian describing the influence of shape and strain on the valence structure in the ($|\dfrac{3}{2}, +\dfrac{3}{2}\rangle$, $|\dfrac{3}{2}, +\dfrac{1}{2}\rangle$, $|\dfrac{3}{2}, -\dfrac{1}{2}\rangle$, $|\dfrac{3}{2}, -\dfrac{3}{2}\rangle$) basis as:	
	\begin{align}
	\label{HVBM}
		{\cal H}_{VBM} =
		\begin{pmatrix}
			p+q & s & r & 0 \\
			s^* & p-q & 0 & r \\
			r^* & 0 & p-q & -s \\
			0 & r^* & -s^* & p+q
		\end{pmatrix}				
	\end{align}
The induced hh/lh mixing is called Valence Band Mixing (VBM).

	Supposing a VBM only caused by strain anisotropy, through the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian, we can write these parameters as function of the Bir-Pikus parameters and the crystal deformation $\varepsilon_{ij}$ ($i,j = x$, $y$, $z$) with $x$ the (100) axis of the crystal lattice and $z$ as defined above. The VBM parameters then writes as follow~\cite{kpMethod}:
	\begin{align}
		p 	&= a_v Tr(\varepsilon) \\
		q	&= b \left(\varepsilon_{zz} - \frac{\varepsilon_{xx} + \varepsilon_{yy}}{2}\right) \\
		r	&= b \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} (\varepsilon_{xx} - \varepsilon_{yy}) - id \varepsilon_{xy} \\
		s	&= d(\varepsilon_{xz} - i\varepsilon_{yz})
	\end{align}
The splitting between the hh states and the lh states can now be calculated in function of the Bir-Pikus parameters:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			\Delta_{lh} &= E_{\pm\frac{3}{2}} - E_{\pm\frac{1}{2}} = (p+q) - (p-q) \\
						&= 2b \left(\varepsilon_{zz} - \dfrac{\varepsilon_{xx} + \varepsilon_{yy}}{2}\right)
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
	
	If we now suppose a system with pure in-plane strain anisotropy ($Q=0$), for an origin of the energy at the top of the valence band, i.e. the hh band, we can rewrite the VBM hamiltonian in the same basis as above as:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{VBM}^{in\ plane} =
		\begin{pmatrix}
			0 & 0 & \rho_s\exp(-2i\theta_s) & 0 \\
			0 & \Delta_{lh} & 0 & \rho_s\exp(-2i\theta_s) \\
			\rho_s\exp(2i\theta_s) & 0 & \Delta_{lh} & 0 \\
			0 & \rho_s\exp(2i\theta_s) & 0 & 0
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{align}
with $\rho_s$ the strain coupling amplitude and $\theta_s$ the angle between axis of the strain induced anisotropy in the QD plane and the $x$ axis. One can notice that in the case of pure in-plane anisotropy, $|+\dfrac{3}{2}\rangle$ only mixes with $|-\dfrac{1}{2}\rangle$ and $|-\dfrac{3}{2}\rangle$ with $|+\dfrac{1}{2}\rangle$. An anisotropy along the $z$ axis, growth axis of the dots, is needed to mix $|\pm \dfrac{3}{2}\rangle$ with $|\mp \dfrac{1}{2}\rangle$. With this notation, in the limit of weak VBM, we can now rewrite the ground state of the holes as pseudo-spin in order to take the hh/lh mixing into account:
	\begin{align}
		|\tilde{\Uparrow}\rangle \propto |+\frac{3}{2}\rangle - \frac{\rho_s}{\Delta_{lh}}\exp(2i\theta_s)|-\frac{1}{2}\rangle \\
		|\tilde{\Downarrow}\rangle \propto |-\frac{3}{2}\rangle - \frac{\rho_s}{\Delta_{lh}}\exp(-2i\theta_s)|+\frac{1}{2}\rangle
	\end{align}
And we have to define new angular momentum operator for these pseudo-spin:
	\begin{align}
		\tilde{J}_+ &= \frac{\rho_s}{\Delta_{lh}}
			\begin{pmatrix}
				0 & -2\sqrt{3}\exp(-2i\theta_s) \\
				0 & 0
			\end{pmatrix} \label{JtildeUP} \\
		\tilde{J}_- &= \frac{\rho_s}{\Delta_{lh}}
			\begin{pmatrix}
				0 & 0 \\
				-2\sqrt{3}\exp(2i\theta_s) & 0
			\end{pmatrix} \label{JtildeDOWN} \\
		\tilde{J}_z &=
			\begin{pmatrix}
				\dfrac{3}{2} & 0 \\
				0 & -\dfrac{3}{2}
			\end{pmatrix}
	\end{align}
$\tilde{J}_{\pm}$ are the ladder operators, flipping the hole spin, whereas $\tilde{J}_z$ return the spin value. This last operator confirm these states are mainly hh. This pseudo spin description is enough in most of the case to understand the effect of the VBM, and we will use it to study how it modify the emission of the quantum dot.

	%\end{align}

	In order to do so, we begin to consider the emission of an charged state. Since, as explained earlier, the exchange interaction is null is such systems, it will allows us to focus only on the VBM effect. We can ignore the envelop function, testing mainly the overlap of the carriers wave function and thus not affecting the polarization of the emission. We write the polarization of the detection $\mathbf{e} = \cos (\alpha) \mathbf{e_x} + \sin (\alpha) \mathbf{e_y}$. We then can find the oscillator strength of the transition:
	\begin{align}		
		\begin{array}{rl}
		\label{VBMPolar}
			\Omega (\alpha) &\propto |\langle \uparrow | \cos(\alpha)p_X + \sin(\alpha)o_Y | \uparrow \downarrow \tilde{\Uparrow} \rangle |^2 \\
							&= 1 + \dfrac{1}{3} \dfrac{\rho_s}{\Delta_{lh}}^2 + \dfrac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \dfrac{\rho_s}{\Delta_{lh}} \cos(2(\theta_s - \alpha))
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
with $\mathbf{p} = -i\hbar\bm{\nabla}$. Contrary to what is expected in the hh approximation, we see that the charged exciton can have a strong linear component, depending on the strength of the lh/hh mixing.

	In the QD presented in Fig.~\ref{XAlLinPol}, the linear polarization rate $\rho_l = \dfrac{2A}{1 + A^2} \approx 40\%$, with $A = \frac{\rho_s}{\sqrt{3}\Delta_{lh}}$ corresponding to a very strong lh-hh mixing, with $\frac{\rho_s}{\Delta_{lh}} \approx 0.75$. Experimentally, no correlation were found between the polarization axis of different QDs, even if they are close to each other, neither with the crystallographic axis. Such a behaviour can be explained considering the anisotropic relaxation of strains occurring during the growth of our QDs~\cite{VBMArticle}. This behaviour was also observed in III-V compounds at low QD density (near the 2D-3D transition), also attributed to the effect of strains~\cite{IIIVFastExcSpinRelax}. For the III-V system, this hypothesis is supported by AFM studies showing that, in such growth conditions, the dots are preferentially nucleating near structural defects~\cite{IIIVAFM}. In the case of II-VI materials, a strained induced hh/lh mixing us not surprising as the dislocation formation energy is lower~\cite{TinjodMBE}.

	For the charged states $X^+$ and $X^-$, only the VBM lead to this linear polarization, leading to the simple picture discussed in this section. However, in $X$ and $X^2$, the VBM and the long range exchange interaction are in competition for the polarization of the emission. The strains tend to polarized it along $\theta_s$ and $\theta_s + 90^{\circ}$, when the long range exchange interaction favour linear emission along $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_1 + 90^{\circ}$. This explains that the angle between the two linearly polarized exciton lines is not equal to $90^{\circ}$. Moreover, the valence band mixing results in a fine structure splitting through the short range exchange interaction that can either enhance or decrease the fine structure splitting due to the long range exchange interaction. In order to illustrate our point, we consider only the isotropic part of the short range exchange interaction between the electron and the light or heavy hole:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{eh}^{sr,iso} = I_{eh} \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{J}
	\end{align}
where $\frac{3}{2}I_{eh}$ corresponds to the energy splitting between bright and dark excitons due to the short range exchange interaction. The coupling between the bright states $|\downarrow \tilde{\Uparrow}\rangle$ and $|\uparrow \tilde{\Downarrow}\rangle$ through ${\cal H}_{eh}^{sr,iso}$ can be calculated using the pseudo-spin ladder operator defined in \ref{JtildeUP} and \ref{JtildeDOWN}:
	\begin{align}
		\langle \downarrow \tilde{\Uparrow} | {\cal H}_{eh}^{sr,iso} | \uparrow \tilde{\Downarrow}\rangle = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{3}} I_{eh} \frac{\rho_s}{\Delta_{lh}} \exp(-2i\theta_s)
	\end{align}
	
	Hence, the valence band mixing through the short range exchange interaction splits the bright states into two linearly polarized states along axis defined by the strain angle $\theta_s$. The competition between this effect and the long range exchange interaction results in an angle between the two linearly polarized states different from $90^{\circ}$, as observed in the emission of CdTe/ZnTe QDs~\cite{DELum} and in InAs/GaAs ones~\cite{PolarIIIV}. Dark states are also coupled to each other in second order, giving them a weak oscillator strenght, with a dipole along $z$. A more in depth investigation of these effects was done in Yoan L\'eger PhD thesis~\cite{YoanTh}.

	
	\section{Exchange interaction between carrier and magnetic atom\label{Exch}}
	
		\subsection{Exchange interaction in Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors\label{ExchDMS}}
		
		We looked until now at the structure of a so-called perfect semiconductor, without defect or impurity. However, we are interested in thesis to introduce a low density of either Manganese or Chromium atoms in the crystal, namely, impurities. A semiconductor doped in this fashion is called Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor (DMS). This magnetic atom will interact with the semiconductor electrons via its localized electrons on its exterior shell. For Mn and Cr in CdTe, this orbital is the $d$ orbital, so it will be the one considered in the following document. From the interactions between these electrons and the one in the conduction band of the semiconductor, new properties will arise. We will try in this chapter to write this interaction as a "Heisenberg" interaction:
		\begin{align}
			{\cal H}_{Heisenberg} = I \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{S}
		\end{align}
with $I$ the interaction constant, $\bm{\upsigma}$ the electron spin and $\mathbf{S}$ the spin of the magnetic atom.
	
	This formally simple interaction represents the Pauli exclusion principle through the interaction between two spins. Almost all the interactions in this chapter will be of this form, although presenting different physical processes, with only the interaction constant $I$ varying from one another.
	
	Both Cr and Mn are close in size to the Cd atoms they replace, so their insertion only induces a small perturbation in the crystal structure, meaning the semiconductor wave function will not be significantly altered by them. We can then as usual note the conduction electron wave function as $|\psi_{\mathbf{k}}\rangle|\sigma;\sigma_z\rangle \equiv |\psi_{\mathbf{k}};\sigma_z\rangle$, $|\psi_{\mathbf{k}}\rangle$ being the Bloch function of the semiconductor. On the other side, considering a magnetic atom at $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{R_d}$, we write the spatial component of the wave function $\Phi_d (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R_d})$. Its total electronic spin, sum of the electron spins on its $d$ orbital, is noted $|S; S_z\rangle$. The whole wave function of the magnetic atom is then $|\Phi_d;S_Z\rangle$.
	
	Using Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we can write the hamiltonian for these electrons:
	\begin{align}
	\label{BOHamil}
		{\cal H}_{BO} = \sum_i \left(\frac{p_i^2}{2m_c} + V_c (\mathbf{r}_i) \right) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 |\mathbf{r_i} - \mathbf{r_j}|}
	\end{align}
The first term is a single particle hamiltonian, taking into account the kinetic energy of the electron and the crystal potential $V_c (\mathbf{r}_i)$ felt by the electron at the position $\mathbf{r}_i$. This potential includes the impurities' potential, meaning it will be different at the impurities positions rather than elsewhere in the semiconductor. The final term represents the Coulomb interaction between the electrons.

	We can rewrite this hamiltonian using second quantification. We define the destruction (resp. creation) operator of a particle in the conduction band at the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ and the spin $\sigma$ as $a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}$ (resp. $a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}^{\dagger}$). In the same fashion, we define the destruction (resp. creation) operator of the electronic level of an impurity as $a_{d, S}$ (resp. $a_{d, S}^{\dagger}$). Supposing the number of electrons on the $d$ orbital of the considered magnetic atom does not change, the hamiltonian \ref{BOHamil} then become:
	\begin{align}
			{\cal H}_{SQ} &= \sum_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma} E_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma} + \sum_{S} E_d a_{d, S}^{\dagger} a_{d, S} + \sum_{\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{k}'} U_{\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{k}'} a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}', \sigma} \nonumber \\
								&\qquad\qquad\quad+ \sum_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma, S} M_{\mathbf{k}} (a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{d, S} + a_{d, S}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j,k,l} V_{i,j,m,n} a_i^{\dagger} a_j^{\dagger} a_n a_m \label{HamilSQ} \\
						&= {\cal H}_0 + {\cal H}_d + V_d + {\cal H}_{hyb} + {\cal H}_{Coulomb} \nonumber
	\end{align}
The constant electron number supposition is good enough for the picture we want to draw since most of the spin-driven interactions do not induce a change of this number.

	${\cal H}_0$ represents the energy of the unperturbed wave function of the semiconductor, with $E_k$ the energy of an electron with the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$.
	
	${\cal H}_d$ is the same as ${\cal H}_0$ but for an electron of the $d$ orbital of the considered magnetic impurity, with $E_d$ the energy of an electron on this orbital.
	
	$V_d$ represents the impurities potential, allowing the semiconductor electrons to scatter on it. However, Mn and Cr does not modify strongly the crystal potential. We can then consider that the states of the semiconductor $|\psi_k\rangle$ are also solution of the full crystal potential, including impurity, and neglect this term.
	
	${\cal H}_{hyb}$, also called the Anderson hamiltonian, mixes the semiconductor states with the states of the impurities. It represents an exchange interaction between an electron of the semiconductor and one of the $d$ orbital of an impurity. We can write the exchange constant as:
	\begin{align}
	\label{Vkd}
		V_{kd} = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \psi_k^* (\mathbf{r}) {\cal H}_1 \Phi_d (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R_d})
	\end{align}
with ${\cal H}_1$ the one particle hamiltonian. This term depends on the Bloch state of both the semiconductor and the impurity, meaning it can be reduced to zero by the symmetry of such functions in some specific cases.

	Let's now focus on last term, ${\cal H}_{Coulomb}$, representing the two particles exchange. $i$, $j$, $m$ and $n$ each represents a full wave function, both spatial and spin part, and can be either an electron of the semiconductor or of one of the impurities. We can then separate this hamiltonian in three different terms depending on the value of $i$, $j$, $m$ and $n$ and illustrated in Fig.~\ref{HybridEner}.
	

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\fcapside{\caption{Carrier interactions with no change of the number of electrons on the impurity, derived from the hamiltonian ${\cal H}_{Coulomb}$. Picture from Laurent Maingault PhD thesis~\cite{LaurentTh}.}\label{HybridEner}}
	{\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=6cm]{01-QD/Pictures/ExchInt.png}
	\end{center}}
	\end{figure}

	We first consider two states belonging to the continuum, appearing as $J_1$ on the diagram. This is the hamiltonian $H_{eh}$ introduced in Sec.~\ref{ehExch}.

	
	The next interaction we consider is the one of two electrons from a localized atom. It represents internal transitions of the atom, representing the Hund rule. It is written:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_U = \sum_{d, S, S'} U a_{d, S}^{\dagger} a_{d, S'}^{\dagger} a_{d, S'} a_{d, S'}
	\end{align}
with $U = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r'} \dfrac{e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0 |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r'}|} |\Phi_d (\mathbf{r})|^2 |\Phi_d (\mathbf{r'})|^2$ the Coulomb interaction between two electrons on the same orbital with different spins. Thus, it costs more energy to add an electron on the same orbital than on another. We find back the Hund rule, with electrons first filing all orbitals with parallel spin before adding an electron to an orbital with another one, with opposed spin.
	
	The third considered interaction is the one between an electron from the magnetic atom and an electron from the semiconductor. In the same fashion as with carriers of the bulk, it can be separated in two terms that will be developed in the next paragraphs: a direct Coulomb interaction between the two electrons, and an exchange interaction arising from the fermionic nature of electrons.
	
	The direct Coulomb interaction doesn't depends on electrons spins. It only act on the total energy of the system and is therefore only needed when searching the total energy of an exciton. We write it:
	\begin{align}
		K &= + \sum_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma, \sigma'} K_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{d, \sigma'}^{\dagger} a_{d, \sigma'} a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma} \\
		\text{with} \nonumber \\
		K_k &= \int \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}' |\psi_k (\mathbf{r})|^2 \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 |\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}|} |\Phi_d (\mathbf{r}')|^2 \nonumber
	\end{align}
It is clear that the spin $\sigma$ (resp. $\sigma'$) of the $k$ electron (resp. $d$ electron) is not changed by this interaction. Since it only induce a shift in the total energy, we can redefine the origin of the energy axis to ignore it.

	To go to the second term, the exchange interaction, we write it in second quantification:
		\begin{align}
			J &= + \sum_{k, k', \sigma, \sigma'} I_{kk'}^{ex} a_{k', \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{d, \sigma'}^{\dagger} a_{k, \sigma'} a_{d, \sigma} = + \sum_{k, k', \sigma, \sigma'} J_{kk'} a_{k', \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k, \sigma'} a_{d, \sigma'}^{\dagger} a_{d, \sigma} \label{sdSQ} \\
			\text{with} \nonumber \\
			I_{kk'}^{ex} &= \int \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}' \psi_{k'}^* (\mathbf{r}) \psi_{k}^* (\mathbf{r}') \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 |\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}|} \Phi_{d}^* (\mathbf{r}) \Phi_{d}^* (\mathbf{r}') \label{sdConst}
		\end{align}
As can be sawn on Eq.~\ref{sdSQ}, this interaction exchange the spin $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ of both electrons, thus its name. Eq.~\ref{sdConst} shows that the spin interaction comes from a Coulomb interaction between two fermions.

	We define:
		\begin{align}
			\begin{array}{l}
				\sigma_{kk'}^z = a_{k, \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k', \sigma} - a_{k, -\sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k', -\sigma} \\
				\sigma_{kk'}^+ = a_{k, \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k', -\sigma} \\
				\sigma_{kk'}^- = a_{k, -\sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k', \sigma}
			\end{array}
		\end{align}
Considering now that this interaction does not change the number of electrons on the $d$ orbital of the considered magnetic atom, we can find the Kondo hamiltonian:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{sd} = - \sum_{k, k'} I_{kk'}^{ex} \bm{\upsigma}_{k,k'}.\mathbf{S}
	\end{align}
Since $I_{k,k'}^{ex}$ is positive, the negative sign in front of the Kondo hamiltonian shows that the energy minimum is reached when the spins of both electrons are aligned, and is therefore ferromagnetic.
	
	We can now write the hamiltonian \ref{HamilSQ}, detailing these new hamiltonians:
		\begin{align}
			{\cal H}_{SQ} &= {\cal H}_0 + {\cal H}_d + {\cal H}_{hyb} + {\cal H}_{eh} + {\cal H}_{U} + {\cal H}_{sd}
		\end{align}
with the exchange constant in ${\cal H}_{hyb}$, $V_{kd} = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \psi_k^* (\mathbf{r}) {\cal H}_1 \Phi_d (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R_d})$.

	We now have two hamiltonians to model the exchange interaction between the impurities electrons and the one in the conduction band of the semiconductor: ${\cal H}_{hyb}$ and ${\cal H}_{sd}$. Schrieffer and Wolff rewrote the Anderson hamiltonian in order to give a form closer to the Kondo hamiltonian~\cite{RelationAnderKondo}:
	\begin{align}
	\label{Ikk'}
			{\cal H}_{hyb} &= ( \sum_{k,k'} V_{kd} V_{k'd} \left(\dfrac{1}{E_k - (E_d + U)} + \dfrac{1}{E_{k'} - (E_d + U)}\right. \nonumber \\
			 				& \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \left. - \dfrac{1}{E_k - E_d} - \dfrac{1}{E_{k'} - E_d}\right)a_{k', \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k, -\sigma} a_{d, S-2\sigma}^{\dagger} a_{d, S} \nonumber \\
			 				&= -  \sum_{k,k'} I_{kk'}^{hyb} a_{k', \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k, -\sigma} a_{d, S-2\sigma}^{\dagger} a_{d, S}
	\end{align}
The Fig.~\ref{EnerTransit} illustrates the different energies introduced in \ref{Ikk'}, presenting virtual transitions to the $d$ orbital of the magnetic atom. The two possible energies are $E_d$ for the low energy level, and $E_d + U$ for the high energy one, $U$ being the energy needed to add an electron to the orbital.

	\begin{figure}[h!]

	\caption{Schema of the band structure and virtual transitions between valence band and conduction band. Picture from Laurent Maingault PhD thesis~\cite{LaurentTh}.}
	\label{EnerTransit}
	\end{figure}

	Doing this transformation is an important step, since we are now able to use a Heisenberg type spin hamiltonian instead of a hamiltonian mixing wave functions, in addition to having the same formalism to write both type of exchange interactions, with just a difference in the exchange constants $I_{kk'}^{ex}$ and $I_{kk'}^{hyb}$.

	Supposing the coupling occurs between two electrons with a close $k$ ($k \simeq k'$), we can rewrite $I_{kk'}^{hyb}$ as:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			I_{kk'}^{hyb} &= 2|V_{kd}|^2 \dfrac{U}{(E_k - E_d)(E_k - (E_d + U)} \\
						&= -2|V_{kd}|^2 \dfrac{U}{(E_k - E_d)(E_d + U - E_k})
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
Fig.~\ref{EnerTransit} presents the case where the magnetic atom ground state is deep inside the valence band. This is the case for the Mn atom. In this case, one can see that $U$ and $E_k - E_d$ are both positive, while $E_k - (E_d + U)$ is negative. Thus, $I_{kk'}^{hyb}$ is negative, and we see that, while exchange leads to a ferromagnetic coupling, hybridization leads to an anti-ferromagnetic one. There will be a competition in the semiconductor between these two for every type of carrier.

	The Cr case is more complicated: its ground state is at the limit between the gap and the conduction band. Therefore, knowing the sign of $E_k - E_d$ and $E_k - (E_d + U)$ is more difficult. It will be discussed more in details in its dedicated part in Sec.~\ref{CrCdTe}.

	Using the same hypothesis done on Sec.~\ref{BandStruct} of small $k$ value, and the value of $V_{kd}$ presented in Eq.~\ref{Vkd}, we can rewrite the exchange constant:
	\begin{align}
		I_{00, \{c,v\}}^{hyb} &= -2 \left(\frac{U}{(E_{\{c,v\}}(0) - E_d)(E_d + U - E_{\{c,v\}}(0))}\right) \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \Phi_r^* (\mathbf{r}) {\cal H}_1 \psi_0^{\{c,v\}} \\
		I_{00, \{c,v\}}^{ex} &= \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}' \psi_0^{*\{c,v\}} (\mathbf{r}) \Psi_d^* \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 |\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}|\psi_0^{\{c,v\}} (\mathbf{r}) \Psi_d} (\mathbf{r})
	\end{align}
In the valence band, the semiconductor's atoms exterior orbitals have the $p$ symmetry, as discussed in Sec.~\ref{BandStruct}. We then write $I_{pd}$ as the sum of the hybridization and the exchange contributions:
	\begin{align}
		I_{pd} =I_{00, v}^{hyb} +  I_{00, v}^{ex}
	\end{align}
In the conduction band, the orbitals are $s$, and so we will write the interaction $I_{sd}$. However, since $s$ orbitals have a spherical symmetry, there is no hybridization contribution. The expression is then pretty easy:
	\begin{align}
		I_{sd} = I_{00, c}^{ex}
	\end{align}

	The same kind of reasoning can be done for the holes in the valence band. However, since the holes have an angular momentum $J = \frac{3}{2}$ instead of a spin $S = \frac{1}{2}$, we have to redefine $I_{pd}$ as $\dfrac{I_{pd}}{3}$. We can now rewrite the Hamiltonian of the interaction with one magnetic atom in the Heisenberg notation:
	\begin{align}
	\label{HSingleAt}
		\begin{array}{rlcccccc}
			{\cal H}_{SQ} &= {\cal H}_0 &+& {\cal H}_{eh} &-& \underbrace{I_{sd} \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{S}} &-& \underbrace{I_{pd} \mathbf{J}.\mathbf{S}} \\
						&= {\cal H}_0 &+& {\cal H}_{eh} &+& {\cal H}_{sd} &+& {\cal H}_{pd}
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
Since a DMS contain a small percentage of magnetic atoms, we can write the hamiltonian of the full semiconductor by summing on their positions. We finally get:
	\begin{align}
	\label{HDMS}
		{\cal H}_{DMS} &= {\cal H}_0 + {\cal H}_{eh} - \sum_i I_{sd} (\mathbf{R}_i) \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{S}_i - \sum_i I_{pd} (\mathbf{R}_i) \mathbf{J}.\mathbf{S}_i
	\end{align}

	This can be further simplified with two approximations. First, since conduction electron sees a lot of different atomic sites, we can we can work with the mean value of the magnetic atoms spins, $\langle\mathbf{S} \rangle$, instead of their individual value $\mathbf{S}_i$. This is the mean field approximation, the magnetic atoms being seen as an effective magnetic field. And for the same reason, we can consider the electron interaction with each site of the crystal multiplied by the probability $x$ of being occupied by a magnetic atom, instead of summing only on the magnetic atoms positions. This is the virtual crystal approximation. We can then rewrite:
	\begin{align}
		\sum_i I_{sd} (\mathbf{R}_i) \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{S}_i = x \sum_{\mathbf{R}} I_{sd} (\mathbf{R}) \bm{\upsigma}.\langle \mathbf{S} \rangle
	\end{align}
Projecting along the quantization axis, we just replace $\bm{\upsigma}.\langle\mathbf{S} \rangle$ by $\sigma_z \langle S_z \rangle$. Since the atoms are seen as a magnetic field, they induce a degeneracy lift $\Delta E_c$ between the two spin values of conduction electron, $|\sigma_z = \pm \dfrac{1}{2} \rangle$:
	\begin{align}
		\Delta E_c = -N_0 x \alpha \sigma_z \langle S_z \rangle
	\end{align}
with $\alpha \propto I_{sd}^{00}$ the interaction constant between the impurity's and the conduction band's Bloch function at $\mathbf{k} = 0$, and $N_0$ the number of cell per volume.
	
	The same consideration can be done for valence band. Hh and lh are separated via their spin values: $|J_z = \pm \dfrac{3}{2} \rangle$ for hh, $|J_z = \pm \dfrac{1}{2} \rangle$ for lh. We then get:
	\begin{align}
		\Delta E_v = -N_0 x \frac{\beta}{3} J_z \langle S_z \rangle
	\end{align}
with $\beta \propto I_{pd}^{00}$ the interaction constant between impurity's and the valence band's Bloch function at $\mathbf{k} = 0$.

	To be completely thorough with the analysis, we should also take into account the confinement due to the quantum dot. This means the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ of the carriers can be different from 0, leading to small perturbative effect on ${\cal H}_{sd}$ and ${\cal H}_{pd}$. This was done thoroughly by Laurent Maingault in the Chap.~I.3 of his PhD thesis~\cite{LaurentTh}. It is shown that the hamiltonian changed as follow:
	\begin{align}
			{\cal H}_{sd} (\mathbf{R}) &= -\alpha \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{S} \left| F_c(\mathbf{R}) - A_2\left( \frac{\partial^2 F_c}{\partial z^2} (\mathbf{R}) + \frac{\partial^2 F_c}{\partial \rho^2}(\mathbf{R})\right) \right|^2 \nonumber \\
										&  \qquad \qquad \qquad - \beta \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{S} \left( (C_2 - B_2) \left| \frac{\partial^2 F_c}{\partial z^2} (\mathbf{R}) \right|^2 + C_2 \left| \frac{\partial^2 F_c}{\partial \rho^2} (\mathbf{R}) \right|^2 \right) \\
			{\cal H}_{pd} (\mathbf{R}) &= -\beta \mathbf{J}.\mathbf{S} |F_v(\mathbf{R}) - V_{kd} F_v''(\mathbf{R})|^2
	\end{align}
with $F_c(\mathbf{R})$ (resp. $F_v(\mathbf{R})$) the electron (resp. hole) envelop function, $F_v'' (\mathbf{R})$ the second derivative of the hole envelop function, and $A_2$, $B_2$, $C_2$ constant depending on the semiconductor lattice. For CdTe, $A_2 = 10.3$ \AA$^{-2}$, $B_2 = 0.781$ \AA$^{-2}$ and $C_2 = 19.8$ \AA$^{-2}$.

		\subsection{Studied magnetic atoms: Mn and Cr}
		
		We will consider in the section the interaction between single magnetic atoms trapped in quantum dots and the carrier. Specifically, we will be interested in the interaction with a Manganese atom and with a Chromium atom. This does not change dramatically the picture we draw in the previous section. However, for the interaction between the semiconductor electrons and the magnetic atom $d$ electrons, we will have to also take into account the overlap between the magnetic atom and the carriers. For a magnetic atom A, we then defined the exchange constant:
		\begin{align}
			I_{eA} &= - \alpha |F_c (\mathbf{R})|^2 \\
			I_{hA} &= - \frac{\beta}{3} |F_v (\mathbf{R})|^2
		\end{align}
			
			\subsubsection*{Mn in CdTe\label{MnCdTe}}
		Using the exchange constant defined above, we can rewrite the hamiltonian \ref{HSingleAt}:
		\begin{align}
		\label{HSingleMn}
			\begin{array}{rlccc}
				{\cal H}_{cMn} &=& {\cal H}_{eMn} &+& {\cal H}_{hMn} \\
								&=& I_{eMn} \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{S}_{Mn} &+& I_{hMn} \mathbf{J}.\mathbf{S}_{Mn}
			\end{array}
		\end{align}
We ignore ${\cal H}_0$ here since it only shift the energy of the system without affecting the spins exchange interactions. In II-VI semiconductors, Mn is inserted as Mn$^{2+}$, with an electronic spin $S=\frac{5}{2}$. We can then write its spin operator as we did for the carriers in Sec.~\ref{BandStruct}:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			S_{Mn, x} &= \begin{pmatrix}
						0 & \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} & 0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & \frac{3}{2} & 0 & 0 \\
						0 & 0 & \frac{3}{2} & 0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} & 0
			  		\end{pmatrix} \\
			\\
			S_{Mn, y} &= \begin{pmatrix}
						0 & -\frac{i\sqrt{5}}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						\frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} & 0 & -i\sqrt{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & -\frac{3i}{2} & 0 & 0 \\
						0 & 0 & \frac{3}{2} & 0 & -i\sqrt{2} & 0 \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & \sqrt{2} & 0 & -\frac{i\sqrt{5}}{2} \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} & 0
			  		\end{pmatrix} \\
			\\
			S_{Mn, z} &= \begin{pmatrix}
						\frac{5}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						0 & \frac{3}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						0 & 0 & \frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{3}{2} & 0 \\
						0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -\frac{5}{2}
				   \end{pmatrix}
		\end{array}
	\end{align}

		In the conduction band, the electrons $s$ orbitals are orthogonal to the $d$ orbital of the Mn atom. No hybridization can then occur. Only the Coulomd interaction remain, leading to an overall ferromagnetic interaction between conduction band electrons and Mn electronic spin. Confirming this, $N_0 \alpha = 0.22 \pm 0.01$ eV was measured~\cite{GajMnD0alphabeta}.
		
		The deduction is a bit harder to work out in the valence band. Valence electrons $p$ orbitals are not orthogonal to Mn electrons $d$ orbital, meaning there is a competition between the ferromagnetic Coulomb interaction and the anti-ferromagnetic hybridization. However, the hybridization is stronger than Coulomb interaction for Mn in II-VI semiconductor, leading to an overall anti-ferromagnetic interaction between holes and Mn electronic spin~\cite{KacmanD0alphabetaIIVI}. For Cd$_x$Mn$_{1-x}$Te, $N_0 \beta = -0.88 \pm 0.01$ eV was measured, confirming this tendency~\cite{GajMnD0alphabeta}.

	
			\subsubsection*{Cr in CdTe\label{CrCdTe}}
		As for the Mn, we can rewrite the hamiltonian \ref{HSingleAt} using the exchange interaction defined in the introduction of this section:
		\begin{align}
		\label{HCrDMS}
			\begin{array}{rlccc}
				{\cal H}_{cCr} &=& {\cal H}_{eCr} &+& {\cal H}_{hCr} \\
									&=& I_{eCr} \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{S}_{Cr} &+& I_{hCr} \mathbf{J}.\mathbf{S}_{Cr}
			\end{array}						
		\end{align}
Once again, we ignore ${\cal H}_0$ since it did not affect the spins exchange interaction. We can also write the Cr spin operators as follow:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			S_{Cr, x} &= \begin{pmatrix}
					0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
					1 & 0 & \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} & 0 & 0 \\
					0 & \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} & 0 & \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} & 0 & 1 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
				   \end{pmatrix} \\
			\\
			S_{Cr, y} &= i
				   \begin{pmatrix}
					0 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
					1 & 0 & -\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} & 0 & 0 \\
					0 & \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} & 0 & -\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}} & 0 & -1 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
				   \end{pmatrix} \\
			\\
			S_{Cr, z} &= \begin{pmatrix}
					2 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
					0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0 \\
					0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -2
				   \end{pmatrix}
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
		
		For conduction band electrons, the situation is the same as with the Mn: the conduction electrons $s$ orbital are orthogonal to the Chromium $d$ orbital, and the hybridization is then null. Hence, only the Coulomb interaction remain and induce a ferromagnetic coupling between the electrons of the band and the Cr electronic spin. $N_0 \alpha$ was never measured in Cd$_x$Cr$_{1-x}$Te, but most magnetic atoms in II-VI semiconductor presents a value between $0.2$ eV and $0.3$ eV. It is then generally assume that, in II-VI semiconductor, $N_0 \alpha \approx 0.2$ eV~\cite{MacspdexchCr}.
		
		%Once again, valence band is a bit 
		In the valence band, the picture for Cr in CdTe is a lot more complicated and still open to discussion: Cr 3$d$ level is almost at the same energy as the top of CdTe valence band, making it hard to decide whether it is in the gap or not. The position of this level is critical and can make the kinetic exchange interaction change sign (see Fig.~\ref{EnerTransit} and Eq.~\ref{Ikk'} for a $d$ level energy $E_d$ in the gap). It is therefore challenging to find theoretically the sign of $N_0\beta$~\cite{BlinowskiFerroCrDMS}. It was however predicted that the sign of the interaction would change between hh and lh.
		
		$N_0\beta$ was never directly measured in Cd$_x$Cr$_{1-x}$Te. Wojtowicz et al. measured the Zeeman spin splitting of 1$S$ excitons and found one coherent with an interaction of opposite signs for lh and hh~\cite{WojtowiczXNewDMS}. The evolution suggest a ferromagnetic interaction for hh and antiferromagnetic for lh. $N_0 \beta$ was found positive in Cd$_x$Cr$_{1-x}$S~\cite{MacCdCrSD0beta} and in most Zn based II-VI semiconductors, assuming $N_0 \alpha = 0.2$ eV~\cite{KacmanD0alphabetaIIVI}. Especially, in ZnTe, still using this assumption, $N_0 \beta = +3.6 \pm 1.2$ eV was found~\cite{MacspdexchCr}. Since there is almost no valence band offset between ZnTe and CdTe, it seems safe to assume that $N_0 \beta$ in bulk CdTe is positive and thus the interaction between Cr and hole spins is ferromagnetic.


	\section{Fine and hyperfine structure of a magnetic atom in II-VI semiconductor}

		\subsection{Mn atom in II-VI semiconductor~\label{MnSemiCon}}
		

		Mn has an electronic structure [Ar]3d$^5$4s$^2$. When inserted into CdTe, it substitute a Cd atom ([Kr]4d$^{10}$5s$^2$). Like the Cd, it bonds with the neighbouring Te atoms with its two $s$ electrons of its outer shell, and thus becomes Mn$^{2+}$ with an electronic structure [Ar]3d$^5$. Since the $d$ orbital is five time degenerated (doubled when taking spin into account), it is half-full in the case of the Mn in II-VI. Following Hund's rule, the spin of those electron are all aligned, leading to an electron spin $S = \frac{5}{2}$ and, following Pauli exclusion principle ranging the electrons angular momenta from $-2$ to $+2$, an angular momentum $L = 0$.

		
		We get from Hund's rule that adding an electron to an half-full orbital has a high energy cost. The lowest energy excited states are therefore the flipping of an electron. For a free atom, it leads to a first excited state with an angular moment $L = 4$. Following the spectroscopic notation of these states $^{(2S+1)}L$, the ground state is the noted $^6$S ($L=0$, $S = \frac{5}{2}$) and the first excited state is $^4$G ($L = 4$, $S = \frac{3}{2}$). The flipping of one electron leads also to higher energy excited states, written in spectroscopic notation $^4$P, $^4$D and $^4$F in Fig.~\ref{MnCrystal}.
		
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{01-QD/Pictures/MnCrystal.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{A schematic diagram of the splitting of the lowest excited states of the $3d^5$ level ($^4$G) relative to the ground state ($^6$S) for a Mn$^{2+}$ ion in the presence of a tetrahedral crystal field.}
	\label{MnCrystal}
	\end{figure}
		
		The interaction with the crystal field will lift the degeneracies of the free atom level. Those new levels are written with the appropriate group theoritical transformation properties. The $^6$S ground state is symmetrical and non-degenrated. Thus, in first order, it is not affected by the crystal field and is noted $^6$A$_1$. On the other hand, $^4$G, the first excited state, is degenerated and therefore is affected by the crystal. It split into four different states: $^4$T$_1$, three-fold degenerated ; $^4$T$_2$, three-fold degenerated ; $^4$E, two-fold degenerated ; and $^4$A$_1$, not degenerated. It has been shown by calculations that the effect of the crystal field is to pull the two $^4$T levels closer to the ground state, while $^4$E and $^4$A$_1$ are almost coincident and almost not affected by the crystal field~\cite{TanabeGroupThMn,SolidStatesPhysics,ThTransMetalIon}. Higher energy excited states would also be affected, but they are at high enough energy for their contribution not to be significant.

	For a free atom, the transition between the ground state with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and any of the excited state, with $S = \frac{3}{2}$ is forbidden by the $\Delta S = 0$ rule and the parity selection ones. However, in a II-VI lattice, the spin-orbit interaction and the absence of inversion symmetry relax those rules, and thus allow the transitions between $^6$A$_1$ and the different states coming from the $^4$G splitting. $^6$A$_1 \rightarrow ^4$T$_1$ is the lowest energy of those transitions and therefore the most significant. It corresponds to approximately 2.2 eV. This transition can kill the luminescence of a semiconductor: the electron-hole recombination excite the Mn transition, flipping a d electron instead of emitting a photon. However, this transition is unlikely to happen. To have a significant effect on the luminescence, we need a semiconductor with a gap wider than the energy needed for the transition and a high concentration of Mn atom. CdTe have a bandgap of 1.6 eV at 5K~\cite{FurdynaDMS}, although it can be widened by the confinement of the QD, and we work at a really low concentration of Mn atoms in order to have QD with only one of them. This phenomena shouldn't then have a noticeable effect on our samples.
	

	$^6$A state of the Mn$^{2+}$ is symmetric and thus not affected by the crystal field nor the biaxial strain. 
However, inserting the Mn in a lattice affect its exterior orbital through the spin-orbit coupling. This interaction is mainly driven by the anisotropy of strain, splitting the spin level according to $D_0S_z^2$, with $D_0$ the magnetic anisotropy and $S_z$ the Mn spin quantified along the $z$ axis. The Mn nuclear spin $I = \frac{5}{2}$ also couple to its electronic spin, giving to the atom an hyperfine structure. The whole hamiltonian of an electronic spin coupled to the nuclear spin of a Mn atom in a strained layer grow along [001] axis is known from electron paramagnetic resonance in CdTe/ZnTe superlattices~\cite{StrainedMn} and reads:
	\begin{align}
	\label{Mnalone}
		\begin{array}{rll}
			{\cal H}_{Mn} &=& {\cal A}\mathbf{I}.\mathbf{S} \\
							& & +\dfrac{1}{6}a (S_x^4 + S_y^4 + S_z^4 - \dfrac{1}{5}S(S+1)(3S^2+3S-1)) \\
							& & + D_0 (S_z^2 - \dfrac{1}{3}S(S+1)) + E(S_x^2 - S_y^2)
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=12cm]{01-QD/Pictures/MnFineStruct.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Top: picture of an idealized strained QD containing a magnetic atom. Bottom: scheme of the energy level of a Mn atom in a strained II-VI QD. All the stable Mn isotopes $^{55}$Mn carries a nuclear spin $I = \frac{5}{2}$ which couples through the hyperfine interaction (${\cal A}\mathbf{I}.\mathbf{S}$) to the electronic spin $S = \frac{5}{2}$.The $d$ orbital of the Mn is also sensitive to the electric field produced by the neighbouring crystal atoms (crystal field) in the zinc-blend lattice. A distortion of the lattice and consequently a change in the crystal field will also affect the $d$ orbital. The dynamic of the Mn spin at zero magnetic field is mainly controlled by a magnetic anisotropy $D_0$ produced by the presence of a large bi-axial strain at the Mn location. This field splits the spin states of the Mn according to $D_0 S_z^2$; the anisotropy of the strain in the quantum dot plane ($E(S_x^2 - S_y^2)$) also mix the different $S_z$ component (green arrow).}
	\label{MnFineHyperfines}
	\end{figure}
	
	The first term is the hyperfine interaction between the Mn nuclear spin $\mathbf{I}$ and its $5d$ electrons spin $\mathbf{S}$, coupling two consecutive Mn spin states through an electron-nuclei flip flop. The hyperfine constant of the Mn was found to be ${\cal A} \approx 0.71$ $\mu$eV~\cite{MnSpinLatticeCoeff}. The second term results from the crystal cubic symmetry and mixes different $S_z$ of the Mn spin. According to ref.~\cite{MnSpinLatticeCoeff}, we have $a = 0.32$ $\mu$eV.
	
	The last line contains terms linked to the strain state at the Mn position: the magnetic anisotropy caused by bi-axial strain $D_0$ and the anisotropy of strain in the $xy$ plane $E$. Because of the partial relaxation of strain in the self-assembled QD we used, the value of $D_0$ may vary between 0 $\mu$eV for a strain-free QD, to 12 $\mu$eV for a fully strain CdTe layer matched on ZnTe. Typical values around 7 $\mu$eV are usually observed in CdTe/ZnTe QDs~\cite{MnResSpinDyn,GorycaPrecession}, leading to the 40 $\mu$eV splitting presented on Fig.~\ref{MnFineHyperfines}. It is responsible for the Mn spin memory at zero magnetic field~\cite{ClaireOptSpinOr}.
	
	The anisotropy in the QD plane induces a mixing between different $S_z$ through the anisotropic crystal field component $E$. It coupled two values of $S_z$ separated by two units of spin. In the absence of magnetic anisotropy ($D_0 \simeq 0$), both the anisotropy of strain and the hyperfine structure prevent the optical pumping of the Mn spin at 0 magnetic field.

		\subsection{Cr atom in II-VI semiconductor\label{CrSemiCon}}
	
		

		Cr atoms are incorporated into II-VI semiconductors as Cr$^{2+}$ ions on cation sites forming a deep impurity level. 90\% of Cr isotopes presents \emph{no nuclear spin}, meaning we do not have to consider their hyperfine structure in II-VI semiconductors. The ground state of a free Cr$^{2+}$ is $^{5}$D with the orbital quantum number L=2 and a spin S=2 yielding a 25-fold degeneracy. In the crystal field of T$_{d}$ symmetry of the tetrahedral cation site in zinc-blende crystal, the degeneracy is partially lifted (see Fig.~\ref{CrinIIVI}): the $^{5}$D term splits into 15-fold degenerate orbital triplet $^{5}$T$_{2}$ and 10-fold degenerate orbital doublet $^{5}$E. The Jahn-Teller distortion reduces the symmetry to D$_{2d}$ and leads to a splitting of the $^{5}$T$_{2}$ ground state into a 5-fold degenerate $^{5}$B$_{2}$ orbital singlet and a $^{5}$E orbital doublet .

		The ground state orbital singlet $^{5}$B$_{2}$ is further split by the spin-orbit interaction. In a strain free crystal, it was found that the ground state splitting can be described by the spin effective Hamiltonian~\cite{EPRCr}:
		\begin{align}
			\label{exchange}
			{\cal H}_{Cr,CF}=D_0S_z^2+\frac{1}{180}F[35S_z^2-30S(S+1)S_z^2+25S_z^2]+\frac{1}{6}a[S_1^4+S_2^4+S_3^4]
		\end{align}
with the Cr spin $S=2$ and $|D_0|\gg|a|$, $|F|$. In the model presented here, we use $a=0$ and $F=0$. The x, y, z principal axes were found to coincide with the cubic axes (1,2,3) giving rise to three identical sites, each given by \ref{exchange} but with the z axis of each along a different cubic axis (1,2,3). A value of $D_0\approx+30$ $\mu$eV was estimated from Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) measurements in highly diluted bulk (Cd,Cr)Te~\cite{EPRCr}.

		\begin{figure}[hbt]
			\label{CrinIIVI}
			\begin{center}
				\includegraphics[width=10cm]{01-QD/Pictures/CrinIIVI.png}
			\end{center}
			\caption{Schema of the energy level splitting of Cr$^{2+}$ at a cation site in II-VI compounds having zinc blende structure (T$_d$) with a crystal field parameter $\Delta$, a Jahn-Teller energy $E_{J-T}$ and a spin-orbit level spacing $D_0$.}
		\end{figure}

		Static biaxial compressive strain in the (001) plane, as observed in self-assembled quantum dots, reduces the symmetry to D$_{2d}$ and destabilize the Cr $3d$ orbitals $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ having an electron density pointing along the $[$001$]$ axis ($z$ axis). The Cr ground state is then a 5-fold degenerated orbital singlet formed from the $d_{xy}$ orbital. It corresponds to the Jahn-Teller ground state with a tetragonal distortion along the $[$001$]$ axis~\cite{DefPonctSemiCon}.

		An applied stress will also  influence the Cr spin fine structure splitting through the modification of the crystal field and the spin-orbit interaction~\cite{EPRCr}. For an arbitrary strain tensor, the general form of the Cr ground state spin effective Hamiltonian is
		\begin{align}
		\label{FullCrHamil}
			{\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon} = c_1 e_A S_{\theta} + c_2 e_{\theta} S_{\theta} + c_3 e_{\epsilon} S_{\epsilon} + c_4e_{\zeta} S_{\zeta} + c_5(e_{\xi} S_{\xi} + e_{\eta} S_{\eta})
		\end{align}
with $S_i$ defined as:
		\begin{align}
			\begin{array}{rl}
			\label{Svalues}
				S_{\theta} &= S_{z}^2  -\dfrac{1}{2} [S_{x}^2 + S_{y}^2] \\
				S_{\epsilon} &= \dfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{3} [S_{x}^2 - S_{y}^2] \\
				S_{\xi} &= S_{y} S_{z} + S_{z} S_{y} \\
				S_{\eta} & = S_{x} S_{z} + S_{z} S_{x} \\
				S_{\zeta} &=S_{x} S_{y} + S_{y} S_{x}
			\end{array}
		\end{align}
and $e_i$ defined similarly as:
		\begin{align}
			\begin{array}{rl}
			\label{evalues}
				e_{\theta} &= \varepsilon_{zz} - \dfrac{1}{2} [\varepsilon_{xx} + \varepsilon_{yy}] \\
				e_{\epsilon} &= \dfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{3}[\varepsilon_{xx} - \varepsilon_{yy}] \\
				e_{\xi} &= \varepsilon_{yz} + \varepsilon_{zy} \\
				e_{\eta} &= \varepsilon_{xz} + \varepsilon_{zx} \\
				e_{\zeta} &= \varepsilon_{xy} + \varepsilon_{yx} \\
				e_A &= \varepsilon_{xx} + \varepsilon_{yy} + \varepsilon_{zz}			
			\end{array}
		\end{align}

		As shown in Sec.~\ref{BPSec}, we can write for a flat self-assembled quantum dot with dominant large biaxial strain:
		\begin{align*}
			\varepsilon_{xx} = \varepsilon_{yy} = \varepsilon_{\parallel} \\
			\varepsilon_{zz}=-2\frac{C_{11}}{C_{12}}\varepsilon_{\parallel}
		\end{align*}
where C$_{11}\approx$ 5.4 10$^{10}$ Pa and C$_{12}\approx$ 3.7 10$^{10}$ Pa are the elastic constants of CdTe~\cite{CdTeElConst}. For this strain configuration, the Cr fine structure is controlled by the spin-lattice coupling coefficients $c_1$ (symmetric coefficient) and $c_2$ (tetragonal coefficients). Strain-coupling coefficients estimated from EPR measurements in bulk Cr doped CdTe are listed in table \ref{StrCouplCoef}.

				-0.25$\pm$2 & +4.9 $\pm$2& -1.25$\pm$0.5 & +4.9$\pm$2 & +3.7$\pm$1.25 \\
				\hline\hline
			\end{tabular}
		\end{table}

		We can now simplify the hamiltonian \ref{FullCrHamil}, first reducing it to the active term in our case:
		\begin{align*}
			{\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon} &= c_1 e_A S_{\theta} + c_2 e_{\theta} S_{\theta}
		\end{align*}
Replacing now $e_A$, $e_{\theta}$ and $S_{\theta}$ by their value given in \ref{Svalues} and \ref{evalues}, and using the equalities given in Sec.~\ref{BPSec}, we can rewrite the strain controlled part of the spin Hamiltonian as ${\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon}$, depending only on $\varepsilon_{\parallel}$:
		\begin{align}
			\begin{array}{rlcc}
			\label{HamilD0}
				{\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon_{\parallel}} &=& \underbrace{\dfrac{3}{2}\varepsilon_{\parallel}[2c_1(1-\dfrac{C_{12}}{C_{11}})-c_2(1+2\dfrac{C_{12}}{C_{11}})]} & S_z^2 \\
													&=& D_0 & S_z^2
			\end{array}
		\end{align}
where we can estimate $D_0\approx 1\pm0.6$ meV from the values of the spin-strain coupling coefficients in CdTe (table \ref{StrCouplCoef}). This is about 100 times stronger than the value found in Mn quantums dots, as stated on Sec.~\ref{MnSemiCon}.
However one should note the quantum dots could be partially relaxed and may contain a significant amount of Zn. This can significantly change the spin-strain coupling coefficients of the Cr atom.

		An anisotropy of the strain in the quantum dot plane (001) with principal axis along $[$010$]$ or $[$100$]$ axes ($\varepsilon_{xx}\neq\varepsilon_{yy}$ and $\varepsilon_{xy} = \varepsilon_{yx}=0$) would affect the Cr fine structure through the tetragonal coefficient $c_3$. This coupling can be described by an additional term in the spin-strain Hamiltonian
		\begin{align}
			\begin{array}{rlcc}
			\label{HamilE}
				{\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon_{\perp}} &=& \underbrace{\dfrac{3}{4} c_3 (\varepsilon_{xx}-\varepsilon_{yy})} & (S_x^2 - S_y^2) \\
												&=& E & (S_x^2 - S_y^2)
			\end{array}
		\end{align}

		This anisotropy term $E$ couples Cr spin states separated by two units and in particular $S_z$=+1 to $S_z$=-1 which are initially degenerated. It could be exploited to induce a large strain mediated coherent coupling between a mechanical oscillator and the Cr spin~\cite{SpinOsciCoupl}.
		
		We can now group \ref{HamilD0} and \ref{HamilE} in order to write the complete hamiltonian of an isolated Cr in a strained, anisotropic CdTe/ZnTe quantum dot:
		\begin{align}
			\begin{array}{lrccc}
				\label{Cralone}
				{\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon} &=& {\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon_{\parallel}} &+& {\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon_{\perp}} \\
										&=& D_0 S_z^2 &+& E(S_y^2 - S_x^2)
			\end{array}
		\end{align}
		
		This strong coupling to strain make the Cr a choice element for spin-mechanical system. This control can be achieved with surface accoustic waves (SAW). Plans are done to deposit on the surface of the sample piezzo-electric material in order to induce SAW along the the $xy$ axis. We can then externally generate in-plane strain to control the Cr spin.
	
	
	\section{A simple example: the X-Mn system\labe{XMn}}
	
	In order to illustrate the concepts explained in this chapter, we will do a quick study of a well known system: the exciton coupled to a single Manganese atom. In order to simplify the study, let's consider a QD containing a single Mn atom with no shape or strain anisotropy. When an exciton is injected in, it will interact with the magnetic atom on top of the hole-electron interaction already taking place for an exciton. The hamiltonian of the system reads:
	\begin{align}
		\label{HXMn}
		{\cal H}_{XMn} = {\cal H}_{eh} + {\cal H}_{eMn} + {\cal H}_{hMn}
	\end{align}
We use in this part the heavy-hole approximation, ignoring the effect of the non-diagonal term of the band hamiltonian. In order to simplify the notation, we write $|S_{z, Mn}\rangle = |S_z\rangle$.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=11cm]{01-QD/Pictures/XMn-Exp.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Photoluminescence of the X, X$^-$ and X$^2$ complex for (a) a undoped QD and (b) a QD containing a single Mn atom.}
	\label{MnSpectra}
	\end{figure}

	In the heavy hole subspace, in the $\sigma_z$, $j_z$, $S_z$ basis, all the hamiltonians describing an interaction with the hole are diagonal. Therefore, the only non-diagonal element in the hamiltonian~\ref{HXMn} describe electron-Mn spin-flips. The hole having no part in this interaction, those spin-flips couple a bright state to a dark state, separated by $\delta_0$, as defined in Sec.~\ref{ehExch}. The strength of this interaction is of the same magnitude of $I_{eMn}$, found to be in the 100 $\mu$eV range in our quantum dots~\cite{DynhMn}. The distance between the bright and dark states is then about one order of magnitude higher than the strength of the interaction. We can thus neglect it.
	
	We can now consider the hamiltonian~\ref{HXMn} to be diagonal. The interaction of the Mn spin with electron is ferromagnetic with $I_{eMn} \simeq -100$ $\mu$eV, while its interaction with the hole is anti-ferromagnetic with $I_{hMn} \simeq 250$ $\mu$eV.  The carriers act as an effective magnetic field along the growth axis. This lift the degeneracy of the Mn spins in a sextuplet. For the bright exciton, with anti-parallel spins, the lift is the strongest. Each Mn spin state is separated from the closest one by $\frac{1}{2}(3I_{hMn} - I_{eMn})$, for a total energy span of $\frac{5}{2}(3I_{hMn} - I_{eMn})$. For the dark exciton states, each of them are separated from the closest one by $\frac{1}{2}(3I_{hMn} + I_{eMn})$, for total energy span of $\frac{5}{2}(3I_{hMn} + I_{eMn})$. The bright and dark excitons are splitted by the electron-hole exchange interaction $I_{eh} \simeq 750$ $\mu$eV. All these splitting are a lot larger than the one induced by the crystal field and the hyperfine structure.
	
	One can note that the system is symmetric under inversion of the quantification axis $z$. Excitons with opposed spins coupled to opposed Mn spins will then be degenerated. For instance, $|S_z = \frac{5}{2}, X_z = -1\rangle$ share the same energy level as $|S_z = -\frac{5}{2}, X_z = +1\rangle$. The whole energy level structure is summarize in Fig.~\ref{MnLevel}.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=12cm]{01-QD/Pictures/MnEnLvl.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Energy level of the ground state and the exciton in a Mn-doped QD. The levels are sketched as a function of the Mn spin $S_z$. Dark states are represented in grey. Optical transitions from the bright states of the Mn complex results in six-line PL spectra, such as in Fig.~\ref{MnSpectra}.}
	\label{MnLevel}
	\end{figure}
	
	The fundamental state of the QD is an isolated Mn atom in the dot. In our QDs, we usually find $D_0 \simeq 7$ $\mu$eV~\cite{MnResSpinDyn,GorycaPrecession}, negligible compared to the exciton-Mn interactions. Since the other fine structure parameters of the Mn are less intense than $D_0$, we choose to neglect their contribution to the spectra. Therefore, the fundamental state of the QD is six time degenerated. The recombination does not affect the Mn spin. Each emission line is thus the superposition of two optical transitions with opposed circular polarization (recombination of an excition $X_z = \pm1$). In a given polarization, each line corresponds then to a single Mn spin: the spectra is a photography of the statistic state of the Mn spin during the exciton recombination.

	
	This simple model is however incomplete. More thorough investigation of the system were done in \cite{YoanTh}. The effects of the VBM, and the strain and shape anisotropy on the system was studied in \cite{DELum}. A complete study of the dynamic of the system was done by Claire Le Gall in her PhD thesis~\cite{ClaireTh}.

\chapter{Growth of Cr-doped CdTe quantum dots\label{Growth}}


	The aim of this thesis was to study the dynamic of single spin in quantum dots. The first step in this study was to grow these doped QDs. We studied to type of quantum dots: self assembled QDs and strain free QDs. The strained dots are formed by the partial relaxation of a CdTe layer on ZnTe. Strain free dots are formed by thickness variation of a CdTe quantum well between CdMgTe barriers. The growth of Cr doped samples were done in Pr. Shinji Kuroda laboratory, in the University of Tsukuba. The Mn-doped samples were grown at Grenoble, in the INAC, by Dr. Herv\'e Boukari.
	
	We will focus in this chapter on the growth done at Tsukuba by Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). We begin by giving some general explanation on the MBE process and the different tools that are used in it. We then go to the growth of the self-assembled quantum dots, detailing the preparation of the substrate and the actual growth, and discussing quickly the results. In the last section, we present two other kinds of sample we grew: samples with the possibility of applying an electric field on them, and the strain free dots. For each of them, we detail the growth process and discuss the results we had studying them. 
	
	\section{Generality on Molecular Beam Expitaxy}	
	
	In the MBE process, cells of pure elements are heated to control their evaporation or until they reach sublimation. Those elements will form the desired crystal on the substrate. They are kept in Knudsen cells, which consist of a crucibles of high-melting-point material with a low contaminating power (typically Pyrolytic Boron Nitride) wrapped in Tungsten filament which will act as heater. Each are closed by a shutter controlled by a computer.
	
	When the desired cell temperature is reached, said shutter is opened to let the element travel to the substrate. The chamber containing the substrate is kept in Ultra High Vacuum (about $10^{-8}$ Pa), in order to avoid contamination of the sample and get a mean free path of the gas long compared to distance to the sample. This process is illustrated on Fig.~\ref{MBEScheme}. Reaching the surface, the atoms diffuse before stopping, either having dissipated their kinetic energy through interaction with the surface, or (more commonly) being kept by island of previously deposited atoms. In the ideal case, the growth occur layer by layer, slowly (about 1 monolayer/s), giving a good control of the thickness of the grown material.
		

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{02-GrowthQDs/Pictures/MBE.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Scheme of a MBE chamber and the cells. An electron gun is also fixed to the chamber in order to probe the surface of the sample.}
	\label{MBEScheme}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	This necessity of Ultra High Vacuum kept the MBE to be developed before the end of the 1960s \cite{FirstMBE}, even though the the idea was formalized at the end of the 19th century. This method offers a good control on the growth, which make it useful for the development of nanostructures. Depositing the materials layer by layer gives the possibility to grow really thin structure, and the transition between two materials can be made abrupt, spanning over only a few monolayer (ML). Growing nano-structure is still the main use of MBE. However, this method is mainly used for research purpose, its slow growth speed and hard to fulfil growth conditions being an obstacle for the industrialization of the process.

	CdTe growth in MBE is \emph{auto-regulated}: if only one element is open, only a given quantity of material will be deposited and then the growth will stop until the other element is also deposited. The deposited quantity of material before the growth stop depends only on the substrate temperature. This allows us to achieve a really fine control of the growth using the MBE mode called Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ALE) or 	Migration-Enhanced Epitaxy (MEE). In this mode, only one element is opened at a time, growing the sample layer by layer with good control on the growth. Between each opening, the sample is left under vacuum in order to relax the surface. A full cycle correspond to opening each cell once. For CdTe, a substrate temperature between 260$^{\circ}$C and 290$^{\circ}$C guaranty a growth of only 0.5 ML for each cycle~\cite{HMarALE}. This allow a small uncertainty on the substrate temperature while keeping a really good control on the growth of the sample.
	
	The growth was monitored with RHEED (Reflexion High-Energy Electron Diffraction). This technique requires a high vacuum, a given since MBE asks for ultra-high vacuum condition. An electron gun sent a beam of high energy electron at a low angle, between 1$^{\circ}$ and 3$^{\circ}$, to the surface sample. This way, the electrons will only probe the surface of the sample, entering the material only on a 3 or 4 ML. Therefore the detected pattern directly gives information on the flatness and the crystallinity of the surface.
	
	Incident electrons have a wave vector $\mathbf{k_i} = 2 \pi / \lambda_e$, with $\lambda_e$ the electron wavelength, typically 6 or 7 pm for an electron gun energy between 30 and 40 kV. Since only scattered diffraction is considered, the diffracted wave vector $\mathbf{k_f}$ as the same norm as the incident one $\mathbf{k_i}$. The Ewald's Sphere has then a radius equal to the norm of $\mathbf{k_i}$. In the reciprocal space, the plane of diffraction are infinite line. So, in the case of a perfect crystal, with a perfect detector, the intersection with Ewald's sphere should be points. However, since the crystal may present some defect and neither the gun or the detector are perfect, the diffracted pattern shows lines.
	
	Once dots are grown, though, the surface become rough at the scale of the length of coherence of the beam. The electrons can interact with more layers while passing through the dots. This can be seen on the diffraction pattern, where lines become points.
	
	Another use of the RHEED diffraction is the monitoring of the number of layer grown. Focusing on the lowest angle reflected spot, called the specular spot, one can see small variations in the reflected intensity during the growth, such as presented on Fig.~\ref{RHEEDOsc}. This intensity is minimal when there is half a ML grown, and maximal when the ML is fully grown. This is due to the variation of reflectivity of the surface: maximal for a flat surface, minimal for a rough one. Therefore, a period of these oscillation is exactly the growth of a single monolayer~\cite{FirstRHEED,WoodRHEED}. We can also see the relaxation of a layer: the surface becomes then rougher, and the specular sport stays at low intensity.

	\section{Strained dots: CdTe/ZnTE\label{SK}}
	
	\subsection{Substrate preparation}
	
		The samples were grown on ZnTe(100) substrates. In order to get the best surface to grow on, we need to clean the sample. Two cleaning methods were tested: etching of the substrate in a Bromure solution, and exposition of the substrate to a hydrogen radical plasma.

		The etching process was done in four steps. All of them, except the etching in Bromure-ethanol, occur in an ultrasonic cleaning device vibrating the sample at 43 kHz and last 3 minutes. We began with a cleaning in acetone, followed by one in ethanol. The third step was the actual etching: the substrate was put in a solution of Bromure-ethanol, with 3\% of Bromure, during 1 minute. We finally rinsed it in methanol. Once rinsed, we keep the sample in ethanol until fixing them to the sample holder. The growth usually occur the day after the cleaning, the sample being kept in the MBE load-lock chamber, under vacuum.
		
		Another type of cleaning of the surface was tried: using hydrogen radical (H$^*$) to remove the impurity at the surface. This was done to get a smoother surface directly in the chamber, to avoid any contamination that might occur during the transport from the etching room to the MBE chamber. The substrate was rinsed four times, first in acetone, then ethanol and then water, for a duration of 5 min with the cleaning device vibrating at 43 kHz, and finally 5 more minutes in water with the cleaning device vibratin at 23 kHz. It was then put in the MBE main chamber to be clean by H$^*$ radicals. In order to form the radical gas, a hydrogen gas was ionized in a chamber by a RF power source of 300 W and with a frequency of 13.6 MHz. This gas composition is optically checked by probing the emission of the Balmer series: for a pure hydrogen gas, peaks at 656 nm and 486 nm appear clearly. During the formation of this gas, the substrate temperature is raised to $400^{\circ}$C and we initiate its rotation. Once the plasma is formed, the valve to the main chamber is opened and the substrate is exposed to the plasma for 15 minutes. In order to check the quality of the surface, we look at the RHEED image, that should present strikes.
	
	\subsection{Strained dots growth\label{SKGrowth}}
	
	The targeted flux chosen for the growth of the CdTe/ZnTe QDs are presented in Tab.~\ref{FluxTempSK} for each cell used during the growth of strained QDs. These flux were measured via the pressure gauge inside the MBE chamber. It was shown that the best quality of ZnTe was achieved for a growth in excess of Zn~\cite{TeEffect}. Otherwise, vacancies appear in the bulk, optically visible, and the surface is more rough. Moreover, the adsorption power of the Zn is smaller than the Te. For these reason, we choose to grow the ZnTe barriers in excess of Zn.
	
	\begin{table}[h!]
	\begin{center}		
		\begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
			\hline
			Elements & Targeted BEP (Torr) \\ \hline
			Zn & $6.8\times10^{-7}$ \\
			Te & $4.5\times10^{-7}$ \\
			Cd & $4.5\times10^{-7}$ \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Aimed flux for each cell during the growth of the strained QDs.}
		\label{FluxTempSK}
	\end{center}
	\end{table}
	
	As previously stated, the CdTe quantum dots was grown using ALE. In this mode, the flux of the elements has no influence on the quantity deposited at each cycle. The only consideration is whether enough material is deposited to reach the maximal thickness in a cycle.
Therefore, the flux for both Te and Cd are chosen to be the same~\cite{HMarALE}. 
	
	Beginning the growth, the substrate temperature was initially raised to $415^{\circ}$C. The Zn cell shutter was open starting at $360^{\circ}$C, in order to flatten the surface for the growth. While it took several minutes to raise the substrate temperature, only one Zn layer was deposited due to the auto-regulation of the growth. When the substrate temperature reach $415^{\circ}$C, the Te shutter was also open, in order to grow the ZnTe buffer layer. This thick ZnTe layer guaranteed us to the best possible surface for the growth of the QD layer~\cite{ChangZnTe}. The surface quality is checked by the RHEED picture, presenting clear lines (Fig.~\ref{RHEEDStep} (b)). Once done, we position the sample is order to have the specular spot on the RHEED screen, growing a few more ZnTe level to see the intensity variation of the reflected spot. The substrate temperature was then lowered to $295^{\circ}$C, the Zn cell being open until the temperature reach $360^{\circ}$C, preparing the growth of the dots doped with Cr atoms.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=14cm]{02-GrowthQDs/Pictures/RHEEDStep.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Left: Layer structure of the strain Cr-doped CdTe QDs samples.

	\label{RHEEDStep}
	\end{figure}
	
	One of the main goal of this work was to calibrate the Cr flux in order to embed only a single Cr atom in most of the QDs of the sample. To achieve this, the Cr density must be of the same order as the QDs density at the surface of the sample. This means a really small flux, with a BEP of the magnitude of $10^{-10}$ Torr, which is about one order lower than the main chamber pressure and therefore not measurable with our technique. The optimisation was done starting with the know how acquired in Grenoble on the Mn and trying to optimise it for the Tsukuba machine, through a feedback loop with the micro-PL characterization in Grenoble.

	This really small flux was achieved by heating the Cr cell around 1000K, low compared to its sublimation temperature, and opening the cell only once during the ALE, for only 5s. In order to have big enough QDs, emitting at right wavelengths, 6.5 ML of CdTe is the optimal thickness. However, the critical thickness of CdTe on ZnTe is 6.5 ML. Dislocations and defect will form in the layer for a higher thickness. Therefore, some samples were also grown with a 5.5 ML thickness in order to not get too close to the limit. At the chosen temperature, it correspond to either 13 cycles of ALE (for 6.5 ML) or 11 cycles (for 5.5 ML). The Cr cells was opened during the 7th cycle, halfway through the growth of the QD layer, in order to allow the Cr atoms to diffuse without going out the QD layers. The whole ALE recipe to grow the QDs layer is given in the Fig.\ref{RecipeSK}.

	\end{center}
	\caption{Opening and closing cycles of each cell for the ALE of strained (Cd,Cr)Te samples.}
	\label{RecipeSK}
	\end{figure}

	After the growth of the CdTe layer, we lowered the substrate temperature to $210^{\circ}$C to deposit the Te layer. It was deposited during 5 minutes. This step allows the CdTe layer to relax and form the quantum dots~\cite{TinjodMBE}. We then heated up the substrate again until $320^{\circ}$C, were we stayed for 20s in order to evaporate all the deposited Te~\cite{WojnarMBE}. If the dots were formed, we saw a spotty pattern like the one presented on Fig.~\ref{RHEEDStep} (f). The Zn and Te cells were then opened, while the substrate temperature was raised to $350^{\circ}$C in order to grow a protective layer above the QDs.
	
	\subsection{Results}
	
	The samples were studied in Grenoble, at the Neel Institute. A high refractive index hemi-spherical Solid Immersion Lens (SIL) was mounted on the sample before their study, to improve the spatial resolution and enhance the collection efficiency of a single dot photoluminescence (PL) in a low temperature (T = 5K) optical microscope.
	
	The characterization of the samples came in two times. First, we took macro-photoluminescence spectra, on a large energy range, typically between 1.8 and 2.3 eV, with a laser exciting at 2.9 eV. This allow us to test the luminescence of the sample: if the Cr concentration is too high, it may kill the PL of the dot layer, and thus it will not be seen in the macro-PL. If this luminescence is seen, the sample is then studied by micro-photoluminescence ($\mu$-PL), on a much narrower energy band (about 10 meV), in order to be able to study the dots individually. We scan randomly the sample, searching for dots. We judge the quality of the sample by the proportion of thin emission peaks versus broad ones, large quantity of broad peaks hinting at a high Cr concentration, and by the number of actual dots we found with single Cr embedded inside.
	
	\begin{table}[h!]
		\begin{center}
			\caption{List of samples where Cr-doped dots growth was successfully achieves.\label{SKsamples}}
			\begin{tabular}{M{2cm}|M{3cm}|M{2cm}|M{3.5cm}}
				Sample & Cleaning process & # CdTe MLs & Cr aimed concentration (\%) \\
				\hline
				dot358 & Br etching & 6.5 & 0.06 \\
				dot359 & Br etching & 6.5 & 0.11 \\
				dot363 & Br etching & 6.5 & 0.21 \\
				dot383 & Br etching & 5.5 & 0.19 \\
				dot385 & Br etching & 5.5 & 0.17
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}
	
	The samples where the Cr concentration was found to be good are listed in Tab.~\ref{SKsamples}. The Cr concentration was estimated using the Cr flux and the known Mn concentration in CdTe in function of the flux of Mn during the growth. Since the Cr flux can't be measured, it was estimated using Arrhenius law. We see that, for most of the sample, the aimed Cr concentration is above 0.15\%. dot358 and dot359 had a lower aimed Cr concentration, but, even though some good dots were found in them, the probability to find one were still low. Tests were done with an aimed Cr concentration at 0.25\%, but no luminescence of the dot layer was found. Therefore, in order to maximize the probability of finding a dot with a single Cr while keeping a good PL, we settled for an aimed Cr concentration of 0.17\%.
	
	\section{Other kind of samples}
		\subsection{Charge control samples\label{ChargedSample}}	
		
	Charge control samples are pretty straightforward. These samples are grown in order to be able to apply an electric field on the dot layer: a Schottky gate is formed by two conductive layers, deposited on the back and the surface of the sample. Gluing electrode to these conductors, we are able to apply an electric field on the dot layer without inducing a current in. In order to have a conductive back, we did the growths on p-doped ZnTe substrate. Same steps were followed, but with thinner buffer and cap layers, in order to be able to apply a stronger electric field on the dot layer. We chose to do both about 150 nm thick.

\begin{table}[h!]
		\begin{center}
			\caption{Measured conductivity of the Au layer on GaAs for different deposition time.}
			\label{AuDep}
			\begin{tabular}{M{3cm}|M{2cm}}
				Gold deposition time (s) & Resistance ($\Omega$) \\
				\hline
				15 & 300 \\
				20 & 80 \\
				25 & 25 \\
				30 & 20 \\
				35 & 0 \\
				60 & 0
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}
	\end{table}
	
	The conductive surface was formed by a thin, semi-transparent gold layer, deposited by sputtering. The samples were kept in nitrogen atmosphere during the transport. The exposition time of the sample in the sputtering machine was calibrated using gold deposited on GaAs substrate. In order to keep a collection of the light emitted by the quantum, a thin layer was necessary. However, for the applied electric field to be unformed, we also needed a gold layer thick enough to be uniformly applied on the entire surface. Such a uniform layer means the resistance of the sample surface fall to 0. Results of the resistance measurement are presented in Tab.~\ref{AuDep}. A deposition time of 35 s was chosen.
	
 	\subsubsection*{Results}
	
	We successfully grew these samples and studied them with $\mu$-PL. We were able to look at the luminescence of a dot and see the evolution of its PL under the application of an bias voltage. Fig.~\ref{ChargeVar} (a) presents the results of such an experiment.

	The main result of the experiment is the apparition of different species depending on the applied electric field. We see for example that, for a bias voltage of +3 V (Fig.~\ref{ChargeVar} (b)), the neutral species are almost extinguish and the charged species X$^+$, X$^{++}$ and X$_2^+$ have the more intense PL. Similarly, at negative electric field, only the charged species X$^-$, X$^{--}$ and X$_2^-$ remain, X$^{--}$ and X$_2^-$ disappearing for an applied bias voltage higher than -2 V. This shows that we can select efficiently the charge of a studied quantum dot applying a bias voltage on it.

	Only one charged sample containing Cr atoms was studied: dot390. It was cleaned by H$^*$ plasma. The QD layer was 5.5 ML thick and the Cr concentration was aimed to be 0.16\%. However, no Cr doped quantum dots were found. Some dots presenting a emission close to the one expected for Cr atoms were found, but they were revealed to not have any magnetic atom inside. These are discussed in more in 
Sec.~IV.4.
	
		\subsection{Strain-free quantum dots\label{SFD}}
		

	
	Strain-free quantum dots are formed by the thickness fluctuations of a CdTe quantum well in Cd$_x$Mg$_{1-x}$Te barriers. These fluctuations form steps localizing the carriers, acting as QDs. The higher the Cd concentration will be, the closer the lattice parameter will be, but it will also reduce the gap energy difference, reducing the confinement. The best strain to confinement ratio was found for CdTe QW in Cd$_{0.7}$Mg$_{0.3}$Te. The needed flux for this growth are shown in Tab.~\ref{FluxTempSFD}.
	
	\begin{table}[h!]
	\begin{center}		
		\begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
			\hline
			Elements & Targeted BEP (Torr) \\ \hline
			Cd & $4.5\times10^{-7}$ \\
			Mg & $1.6\times10^{-8}$ \\
			Te & $5.26\times10^{-7}$ \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Aimed flux for each cell during the growth of the strained samples.}
		\label{FluxTempSFD}
	\end{center}
	\end{table}
	
	The strain-free sample were grown on an hybrid substrate. It was made from a GaAs substrate, cleaned using H$^*$ plasma. We grew on it a CdTe layer of about 3 $\mu$m, in order to recover the lattice parameter and not have defect close to the surface. With this thickness, the remaining strains in the layer should be of about $0.1\%$~\cite{StrainRelaxCdTeGaAs111,StrainRelaxCdTeGaAs100}. A thin layer (about 7 nm) of ZnTe was grown between the GaAs and the CdTe in order to help the relaxation of strains~\cite{StrainRelaxZnTeGaAs001}. The RHEED taken after the growth of the CdTe layer (Fig.~\ref{Hybrid} (d)) shows sharp straight line, hinting at the recovery of a flat surface. A protective layer of amorphous Te was grown on the surface to keep it from being damaged outside the MBE chamber.

	\label{Hybrid}
	\end{figure}
		
		
	
	We began to heat the substrate temperature to 300$^{\circ}$C, in order to remove the protective amorphous Te layer. We waited a few seconds at this temperature to remove all the deposited Te, and then resumed the heating to go to $360^{\circ}$C. Starting at $320^{\circ}$C, we opened the Te cells in order to stabilize the surface. When the substrate temperature was stabilized at $360^{\circ}$C, we opened the Cd cells and grew a 2.35 $\mu$m layer of CdTe, in order to be as close as possible of a total lattice parameter recovery ~\cite{StrainRelaxCdTeGaAs111,StrainRelaxCdTeGaAs100}.
	
	We grew the first Cd$_{0.7}$Mg$_{0.3}$Te barrier on this buffer layer. In order to be sure that there will be no relaxation in the quantum well, we choose to stick to the maximum cumulated thickness of the CdTe on a CdZnTe lattice, which has been shown to be lower than the one of CdTe on a CdMgTe lattice. This correspond to a maximum cumulated thickness of 130 nm \cite{CritThickCdTeCdZnTe}. We chose to grow 40 nm below the QW, and 90 nm above it, in order to have a thicker protective layer.

	Once the 40 nm barrier layer was grown, we lowered the substrate temperature under Te flux. Growing the QW layer in a Te environment smooth the surface layer of the sample and help having a flat surface to grow the well. Once the substrate temperature reach respectively $295^{\circ}$C, we began the ALE of the QW. Two QW thickness was tested: either 4 ML or 2 ML. In both case, the growth was done growing CdTe layer as done for the strained sample, opening the Cr cell for 3 s for one cycle every two cycles. The whole recipe is described in Fig.\ref{RecipeSFD}.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{02-GrowthQDs/Pictures/RecipeSFD.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Opening and closing cycles of each cell for the ALE of strain free (Cd,Cr)Te samples.}
	\label{RecipeSFD}
	\end{figure}
	
	We then raised the substrate temperature up to $360^{\circ}$C, under a Te flux, in order to proceed to the growth of the upper barrier, acting also as a protective layer. The opening time was there calculated to grow 90 nm of Cd$_{0.7}$Mg$_{0.3}$Te.

	\subsubsection*{Results}
	
	Four sample of strain-free dots doped with Cr were produced, listed in Tab.~\ref{SFDsamples}.
	
	\begin{table}[h!]
		\begin{center}
			\caption{List of sample grown trying to incorporate Cr in SFD dots.\label{SFDsamples}}
			\begin{tabular}{M{2cm}|M{2cm}|M{3.5cm}|M{3cm}}
				Sample & # CdTe MLs & Cr aimed concentration (\%) & Probability of Cr-doped QD \\
				\hline
				SFD4 & 4 & 0.35 & None found \\
				SFD5 & 2 & 0.15 & None found \\
				SFD6 & 2 & 0.54 & None found \\

		\end{center}
	\end{table}
	
	
	The sample presented thin and intense peaks. It hints at a better confinement of the carriers in the QDs than what have been expected from dots formed by the thickness variation of a quantum well. This may be caused by higher steps than expected at the CdTe/Cd$_{0.7}$Mg$_{0.3}$Te interface.
	
	As discussed in 
Sec.~I.4, the presence of a magnetic atom splits the emission of the exciton into several peaks, the number depending on the spin of the magnetic atom. However, such complex wasn't found in the strain-free samples. It may be caused by the the absence of static Jahn-Teller effect. In strain dots, this effect increase the probability of the Chromium to have a quantization axis along the growth axis $z$, making the splitting visible in our experimental setup. Without strain, the Jahn-Teller effect doesn't discriminate anymore between the three different axis, and thus the Chromium spin might have a quantization axis along $x$ or $y$. In this case, there is no visible splitting for the quantum dot in our experimental setup, and the magnetic atom goes undetected.
	
	In order to counter that, it was proposed to slightly strain the quantum well. This might be done by incorporating a low density of Zn in the Cd$_{0.7}$Mg$_{0.3}$Te barrier. The strains created this way should be enough to increase the probability of quantization along the $z$ axis, while staying negligible in regard of the Cr spin energy structure and dynamics. Such samples should be grown in the near future.
	
	\section*{Conclusion}
	
	We saw in this chapter how we grew the samples that will be studied in the next chapters. We used the characterization of the samples done in Tsukuba to narrow down on a Cr flux for the growth of Cr-doped QDs, and we decided to aim for a Cr estimated concentration in the sample	 of 0.17\%. We then went to two other kind of sample: one enabling the application of an electric field on the dots, and one with strain free dots. The charge control samples growth was a partial success: we were able to apply an electric field on the sample, but no dot containing a single Cr was found. Strain-free dot presented promising fine peaks in their emission, but we were not able to find Cr in them either. More experiments will be done in order to successfully grow sample with the possibility of charge control, and strain-free dots.
	
	In the next chapters, we will study with $\mu$-PL dots found in the samples grown in Grenoble (
Chap.~III) and Tsukuba (
Chap.~IV and 
Chap.~V).








\chapter{Coherent dynamics of Mn-doped positively charged quantum dots\label{CoDynMn}}

	Mn atom in II-VI has been studied since more than a decade~\cite{FirstMn} and is now a well known system. Most of the studies was done on the exciton-Mn, since it is the first excited state of the quantum dot. However, the other excited states behave differently due to the presence of other carrier(s) aside the single exciton.
	%Bi-exciton was studied by Lucien Besombes \emph{et al.} a few years ago~\cite{}.
	We propose here to study a single Mn atom in a positively charged quantum dot.
		
	We begin presenting the energy structure of a Mn atom in a II-VI quantum dot. We see that the hybrid hole-Mn spin in the ground state and the positively charged exciton coupled to Mn spin in a CdTe/ZnTe quantum dot, system dominated by the e-Mn interaction, form an ensemble of $\Lambda$-level systems that can be addressed independently. Those systems can be addressed optically and used to study the dynamic of the hole-Mn hybrid spin.
	
	In the second section, we study the spin relacation channels of this multilevel spin system through two experiments: auto-correlation of the resonant PL and resonant optical pumping experiments. We identified an efficient relaxation channel for the h-Mn hybrid spin by the interplay of the exchange interaction between the hole and the magnetic atom, as well as the coupling to accoustic phonons. We also show that the optical $\Lambda$-systems are connected through inefficient spin-flips that can be enhanced under weak transverse magnetic field. The dynamics of the resonant PL of a p-doped magnetic QD is well described by a complete rate equation model.   	
	
	In the last section, we look at the electron-Mn coherent dynamics, directly observed in the time domain. Quantum beats reflecting the coherent transfer of population between e-Mn spin states, mixed by an anisotropic strain in the plane of the quantum dot, are clearly observed. We highlight that this strain induced coherent coupling is tunable with an external magnetic field.

	\section{Mn in a II-VI positively charged quantum dot}

		
		\subsection{Spin structure of a positively charged Mn doped quantum dot}
		
		We saw in 
		Sec.~I.4
		 that the exchange interaction between the hole and the Mn spin lift the degeneracy of the Mn spin states. The recombination lines of the exciton states are then  each split into six. For a given polarization, each line corresponds to a give Mn spin state. The ground state of a Mn-doped positively charged quantum dot is formed by a single hole coupled to the Mn atom, leading to the same kind of splitting. This hole can be trapped via the application of a positive bias voltage on the sample with a Schottky gate (see 
		Sec.~II.2.1
		), a single hole is trapped in the magnetic QD and only the emission of the positively charged exciton is observed (Fig.~\ref{hMnspectra} (a)). The PL of such a QD is presented on Fig.~\ref{hMnspectra} (b).
		
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	{\caption{(a) Color scale plot of the PL intensity of the studied Mn doped QD inserted in Schottky structure showing the emission of the neutral (X-Mn) and positively charged (X$^+$-Mn) exciton as a function of energy and bias voltage.

	{\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=12cm]{03-h-Mn/Pictures/DotPres.eps}
	\end{center}}
	\end{figure}
	
	As discussed in 
		Sec.~I.3.1, in a strained self-assembled CdTe QD, a Mn atom exhibits a fine structure dominated by a weak magnetic anisotropy with an easy axis along the QD axis. Neglecting the tetrahedral crystal field of the CdTe matrix, this fine structure is described by the effective spin Hamiltonian:
\begin{align}
\label{MnCF}
{\cal H}_{Mn,CF}=D_0S^2_z+E(S_x^2-S_y^2)
\end{align}
with $D_0$ depicting the effect of the biaxial strain and $E$ describing the anisotropy of the strain in the plane of the QD. It was shown that the anisotropy of strain was essential to understand the absence of pumping for Mn in strain-free quantum dots~\cite{OptControlSpin} and was thus include here to keep generality. We will study more in details its effect in Sec.~\ref{SpinDyn}.

	When a hole is trapped in a QD containing a single Mn, the spin structure is controlled by the hole-Mn exchange interaction that reads:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{hMn}^{ex}=I_{hMn}\mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{J}
	\end{align}
with $I_{hMn}$ the exchange energy between the hole and the Mn ($S=5/2$) and $\mathbf{J}$ the hole spin operator. In the presence of heavy-hole/light-hole mixing, $\mathbf{J}$, represented in the basis of the two low energy heavy-hole states, is related to the Pauli matrices by $J_z=3/2\tau_z$ and $J_{\pm}= \xi \tau_{\pm}$ with $\xi=-2\sqrt{3}e^{-2i\theta}\rho_c/\Delta_{lh}$, $\tau_+ = \tau_x + i\tau_y$ and $\tau_- = \tau_x - i\tau_y$, $\tau_x$, $\tau_y$, $\tau_z$ being the Pauli matrices. $\rho_c$ is the coupling energy between heavy holes and light holes separated by an effective energy splitting $\Delta_{lh}$. $\theta$ is the angle relative to the [110] axis of the principal axis of the anisotropy (shape and/or strain) responsible for the heavy-hole/light-hole mixing \cite{SingleExcSpectro,VBMArticle}. For a weak valence band mixing, the hole-Mn energy levels are mainly controlled by $I_{hMn}S_zJ_z$ and form 12 eigenstates organized in 6 doublets with well-defined $S_z$ and $J_z$. These states are labelled $|S_z,J_z\rangle$.

	The h-Mn exchange interaction lift the degeneracy of the Mn spin states according to the Mn and hole spin. This splitting is wide enough to keep the hole-Mn states to be affected by the valence band mixing. Only the states $|-1/2\rangle|\Uparrow_h\rangle$ and $|+1/2\rangle|\Downarrow_h\rangle$ stay degenerated when applying the exchange interaction, while also mixed by the VBM. We should then only observe linear polarization dependency on the peaks associated with those states.


	\begin{figure}[h!]
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=14.8cm]{03-h-Mn/Pictures/Recomb.png}
		\end{center}
		\caption{Electron-Mn spin states for each $|M,M_z\rangle$. For each $M$, the $\sigma-$ (red) and $\sigma+$ (blue) probability is highlighted. This probability is directly linked to the intensity of each peak. In the center, the different possible recombination paths for $M=3$ and $M=2$ are presented. A schema of the resulting spectra is drawn below.}
		\label{Recomb}
	\end{figure}
	
	In the QD excited state, an exciton is injected in. With the hole electrically injected inside, it forms a positively charged exciton X$^+$, coupled with the Mn atom. The two holes paired up with anti-parallel spins, and thus the system is dominated by the electron-Mn exchange interaction:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{eMn}^{ex} = I_{eMn} \mathbf{S}.\bm{\upsigma}
	\end{align}
with, as usual, $\bm{\upsigma}$ as the electron spin and $I_{eMn}$ as the e-Mn exchange energy. This interaction is isotrope, and results in a ground state septuplet of total spin $M = 3$ and a fivefold degenerated manifold of total spin $M = 2$, for a total of twelve electron-Mn states. In the absence of perturbations, the energy levels of each of those manifold are degenerated. Each of those states are labelled $|M,M_z\rangle$. They are presented in Fig.~\ref{Recomb}, as well as the resulting recombination from each of the manifold. One can see that each state emit at a given energy, resulting in a twelve peaks spectra. Each electron-Mn state corresponds to a given peak energy and polarization.

	Since the two holes have opposite spins, their exchange interaction with the Mn atom only introduce a perturbation to the electron-Mn wavefunction~\cite{CarInSpinSplit,BiexFinStruct,LucienSFD}. This can be represented for one hole by an effective spin Hamiltonian ${\cal H}_{scat}=-\eta S_z^2$ with $\eta>0$. It has to be taken into account twice for X$^+$-Mn where two holes interact with the Mn. It affects the energy of the optical recombination of X$^+$-Mn to the hole-Mn ground state, introducing a parabolic splitting of the e-Mn states, and can be observed in the emission spectra through the unequal splitting between each peaks~\cite{LucienSFD}.
	
	As shown in Fig.~\ref{Recomb}, in a given polarization, we can associate a transition from an excited state to a single ground state. As discussed in 
	Sec.~I.1.1
	, the polarization of the transition is given by the spins of the recombining carriers, without affecting the Mn spin, as shown in 
	Sec.~I.4
	. We then see that all level associated with the $M=2$ quintuplet can recombine in both polarizations, while only 6 level of the $M = 3$ septuplet can recombine in a given polarization. This leads to 11 spectrally resolved lines. Each of these lines can be associated to a single e-Mn state.
	
	To illustrate this association, let's consider the recombinations in $\sigma+$ polarization, meaning we consider the annihilation of the e-h pair $|\downarrow_e, \Uparrow_h \rangle$. We then have an excited state of the form $\alpha |S_z, \downarrow_e \rangle + \beta |S_z - 1/2, \uparrow_e \rangle$ and a final state $|S_z, \Downarrow \rangle$, which is an eigenstate of the hamiltonian ${\cal H}_{h-Mn}$. The intensity of the optical transition is given by the overlap $\langle M, M_z | S_z, \downarrow_e \rangle$, which is the Clebsh-Gordan coefficient appearing in the composition of a spin 1/2 with a spin 5/2, here noted $\alpha$ for the initial state associated with the $\sigma+$ transition. Let's focus on the transition linked with the high energy final state $|-5/2, \Downarrow_h \rangle$. In order to have this state as a final state, the initial state have to be $|\Uparrow_h, \Downarrow_h \rangle \times |-5/2, \downarrow_e \rangle$. Only the excited state $|3, -3 \rangle$ have this e-Mn state, this transition being forbidden from the $M=2$ quintuplet. Since $|3, -3 \rangle$ is a pure e-Mn state, this transition has the highest optical transition weight.

	\caption{(a) Energy levels of the ground (h-Mn) and excited ($X^+$-Mn) states as a function of their angular momentum (M$_z$). The levels in dotted lines corresponds to the h-Mn states $|-1/2\rangle|\Uparrow_h\rangle$ and $|+1/2\rangle|\Downarrow_h\rangle$ coupled by the valence band mixing. Optical recombination towards these levels leads to the linearly polarized lines observed in (b). (b) Experimental (left) and calculated (right) color-scale plot of the linear polarization dependence of the PL of X$^+$-Mn at B = 0 T (top) and B$_\perp$ = 0.42 T (bottom).

	\label{CompleteEnerStruct}
	\end{figure}	
	
	We can repeat this operation with each h-Mn state, in both polarization. They can be all be associated with both $|2, M_z \rangle$ and $|3, M_z \rangle$ initial state, with optical weight lying between 1/6 and 5/6. The only exception is the other high energy final state, $|+5/2, \Uparrow_h \rangle$, only associated with the initial state $|3, +3 \rangle$ in $\sigma-$ polarization. For a given polarization, we then have 11 resolved lines. The resulting PL for the X$^+$-Mn is illustrating at the bottom of Fig.\ref{Recomb} and can be saw as a superposition of two structures: six lines with intensity decreasing with increasing their energy position (transitions from $M=3$ states) and fives lines with intensities increasing with increasing their energy position (transitions from $M=2$ states).

	We can write the ground state total hamiltonian:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			{\cal H}_{hMn} =& {\cal H}_{hMn}^{ex} + {\cal H}_{CF, Mn} \\
							=& I_{hMn} \mathbf{S}.\mathbf{J} + D_0 S_z^2 + E (S_x^2 - S_y^2)
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
and, for the excited state X$^+$-Mn:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			{\cal H}_{X^+-Mn} =& {\cal H}_{eMn}^{ex} + 2 {\cal H}_{scat} + {\cal H}_{CF, Mn} \\
							=& I_{eMn} \mathbf{S}.\bm{\upsigma} - 2\eta S_z^2 + D_0 S_z^2 + E (S_x^2 - S_y^2)
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
The full energy structure given by those hamiltonian is presented in Fig.~\ref{CompleteEnerStruct}, along with the linear polarization map of the probed QD. Values of $I_{hMn}$, $I_{eMn}$, $\rho_c/\Delta_{lh}$ and $\eta$ for a given QD can be obtained by comparing the linear polarization dependence of the experimental PL data to the optical transition probabilities calculated with the discussed effective spin model (Fig.~\ref{CompleteEnerStruct} (b)) \cite{DynhMn}. A Boltzmann distribution function $P^i_{eMn}=e^{-E^i_{eMn}/k_BT_{eff}}/\sum_{i}e^{-E^i_{eMn}/k_BT_{eff}}$ with an effective spin temperature $T_{eff}$ is used to describe the population of the emitting states (electron-Mn energy levels $E^i_{eMn}$). The obtained parameters are listed in Tab.~\ref{paraQD} for the QD presented in Fig.~\ref{hMnspectra} and \ref{CompleteEnerStruct}.
	

		\subsection{Optical $\Lambda$-level identification\label{LambdaId}}	
		
		\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=12cm]{03-h-Mn/Pictures/Lambdasyst.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{(a) Non resonant (Non Res.) and resonant (Res.) PL of X$^+$-Mn. Co and cross circularly polarized PL spectra are collected for three different energies of the CW resonant laser (green). Inset: intensity map of the cross-circularly polarized PL detected on the low energy side of X$^+$-Mn as the CW laser is scanned through the high energy side. (b) Energy levels of X$^+$-Mn and identification of the three resonances observed in (a) corresponding to the optical $\Lambda$ systems associated with the e-Mn states $|3,+1\rangle$, $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|2,+2\rangle$.}
	\label{LambdaLevel}
	\end{figure}
		
	Scanning in energy the high energy side of the PL in $\sigma+$ polarization, three sharp emissions can be seen on the low energy side. Those are presented in the inset of Fig.~\ref{LambdaLevel} (a), labelled (1), (2) and (3). These emissions are strongly $\sigma-$ polarized, cross-polarized with the excitation, with the exception of (1), which PL is unpolarized. Comparing the laser energy to the QD X$^+$-Mn spectra, we see that those peaks appears when the laser is in resonance with specific QD peaks. To each of those peak, we can associate one of low energy ones.
	
	This type of emission hints at the existence of $\Lambda$-level systems linking one excited state to two ground states. These systems arise for the structure of the e-Mn states. For a given excited state, we have $|M, M_z\rangle = \alpha |S_z, \uparrow_e\rangle + \beta |S_z - 1/2, \downarrow_e\rangle$. The first state recombine with the hole-Mn state $|S_z, \Downarrow\rangle_h$, emitting in $\sigma-$ polarization, while the $|S_z - 1/2, \downarrow_e\rangle$ recombine with $|S_z - 1/2, \Uparrow_h\rangle$, emitting in $\sigma+$ polarization. In the excited state, the system is able to go freely from one state to another via an electron-Mn flip-flop. This leads to the $\Lambda$-level structures we observed.
	
	Using Fig.~\ref{Recomb}, we can assign each peak to a transition and therefore, for a given polarization, to an electron-Mn state. They correspond, for a $\sigma+$ laser, to the successive resonant excitation of the electron-Mn levels $|3,+1\rangle$, $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|2,+2\rangle$. These states can be expressed as linear combinations of the Mn and electron spins $|S_z,\sigma_z\rangle$ coupled by a flip-flop:
	\begin{align}
		|3,+1\rangle=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(\sqrt{4}|+1/2,\uparrow_e\rangle+\sqrt{2}|+3/2,\downarrow_e\rangle)\\
		|3,+2\rangle=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(\sqrt{5}|+3/2,\uparrow_e\rangle+\sqrt{1}|+5/2,\downarrow_e\rangle)\\
		|2,+2\rangle=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(\sqrt{1}|+3/2,\uparrow_e\rangle-\sqrt{5}|+5/2,\downarrow_e\rangle)
	\end{align}
Each of those $\Lambda$-systems are illustrated on Fig.~\ref{LambdaLevel} (b). The energy splitting between the resonant absorption and the emission corresponds to the splitting between the two ground states of the $\Lambda$ system. It is given by 4$\times$3/2$I_{hMn}$($\approx$2.1 meV for the studied QD) for an excitation of $|3,+2\rangle$ or $|2,+2\rangle$ and 2$\times$3/2$I_{hMn}$($\approx$1.05 meV for the studied QD) for an excitation of $|3,+1\rangle$. For an excitation of $|3,+2\rangle$ or $|2,+2\rangle$, the weak co-polarized PL signal, which depends on the excitation intensity, comes from a possible direct excitation of the low energy branch of the $\Lambda$ system through the acoustic phonon side-band \cite{BesombesAccPhon}.
			
	
	\section{Spin dynamics under resonant excitation\label{SpinDyn}}
	
	
		\subsection{Cycling and escaping the $\lambda$-level system}

	
	For an isolated $\Lambda$ system, under resonant excitation of one of the branch, a fast optical pumping controlled by the generation rate and the radiative lifetime of the excited state is expected: the population is expected to be stored in the level which is not excited and the resonant PL should vanish. In the case of X$^+$-Mn, the PL intensity observed under resonant excitation of the high energy branch of the $\Lambda$ systems is similar to the PL intensity obtained under non-resonant excitation. This suggests a very inefficient optical pumping of the hole-Mn spin and an efficient spin-flip mechanism which links the two ground states of the $\Lambda$ systems.

		\includegraphics[width=14.8cm]{03-h-Mn/Pictures/ResAutocor.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Auto-correlation of the resonant PL for cross-circularly polarized excitation and detection of the electron-Mn states (a) $|3, +1\rangle$, (b) $|3, +2\rangle$ and (c) $|2, +2\rangle$.}
	\label{AllAutocorB0}
	\end{figure}
	
	The dynamics of the Mn spin coupled to carriers was first analyzed, under resonant optical excitation, through the statistics of the time arrival of the photons given by the second order correlation function of the resonant PL intensity, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$. For the three resonant excitation conditions reported in Fig.~\ref{AllAutocorB0}, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ is mainly characterized by a large photon bunching with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the 20 ns range. The amplitude of the bunching reaches 9 for line (2) and is slightly weaker for the two other lines. This large bunching, reflecting an intermittency in the emission of the QD, is not sensitive to a longitudinal magnetic field B$_z$ except for an excitation on (1).

	The presence of a photon bunching is surprising at first: under resonant excitation of an isolated $\Lambda$ system, an anti-bunching of the resonant PL controlled by the transfer time between the two ground states is indeed expected. For X$^+$-Mn, the observed short anti-bunching (dip near zero delay, better evidenced in Fig.~\ref{AllAutocorB0} (b)) suggests a fast transfer time in the nanosecond range between the two ground states of the $\Lambda$ systems.

	\end{figure}

	In the presence of a transfer process connecting the two hole-Mn ground states in a nanosecond time-scale ($\tau_{ff}$), the photon bunching can be explained by leaks outside the resonantly excited $\Lambda$ system. Under CW excitation, the population is cycled inside the $\Lambda$ system until a spin flip occurs and drives the carrier-Mn spin out of the $\Lambda$ levels under investigation. The resonant PL is then switched off until multiple spin-flips drives back the carriers and Mn spin inside the $\Lambda$ system under excitation. The selected QD line can be either in a ON or OFF state depending on the fluctuations of the carrier and Mn spins. The amplitude of the bunching is then given by $\Gamma_{Out}/\Gamma_{In}$ the ratio of the transition rates from OFF to ON ($\Gamma_{In}$) and from ON to OFF ($\Gamma_{Out}$). An amplitude of bunching larger than 1 is expected for the multilevel system considered here where, after a spin relaxation, multiple spin flips are in average required to come back to the initial state ($\Gamma_{In}<\Gamma_{Out}$). Within this picture, the width of the bunching is a measurement of the escape time out of the considered $\Lambda$ level system. We present these transitions in Fig.~\ref{LambdLoop}, on the $\Lambda$ system associated with $|3, +2\rangle$ state.

			\label{AutocorExpBPw}
		\end{figure}
	
	A weak transverse magnetic field, $B_x$, significantly reduces the width of the bunching signal (Fig.\ref{AutocorExpBPw} (b)). As the spin of the hole-Mn complex is highly anisotropic, with a large energy splitting induced by the exchange interaction $I_{hMn}S_z.J_z$, the weak transverse magnetic field mainly affects the electron-Mn dynamics in the excited state of the charged QD. Indeed, the transverse magnetic field couples the different electron-Mn states and induces a leak outside the resonantly excited $\Lambda$ system. Both spin-flips within the hole-Mn (ground state) and the electron-Mn (excited state) systems can contribute to the bunching signal. The significant effect of the weak transverse field shows that the probability of presence in the excited state of the $\Lambda$ system is large. This is consistent with the large excitation intensity used for these auto-correlation measurements which require a high photon count rate.

	A slight reduction of the width of the bunching signal is also observed with the increase of the excitation power (Fig.\ref{AutocorExpBPw} (a)). This shows that the leaks outside a given $\Lambda$ system slightly increases with the probability of presence of the positively charged exciton in the QD.

The insets present the corresponding states which are resonantly excited and detected in $\sigma-$ polarization.}
	\label{AllPumpB0}
	\end{figure}
	
	Resonant optical pumping experiments were done to estimate how long it takes, after a spin-flip, for the hybrid hole-Mn spin to relax back inside the resonantly excited $\Lambda$ system. A demonstration of resonant optical pumping of the hole-Mn system was first done by exciting the high energy branch of the $\Lambda$ systems with trains of resonant light, alternating the circular polarization and recording the circularly polarized PL of the low energy branch. As observed in Fig.~\ref{AllPumpB0}, for an excitation on resonance with the electron-Mn states $|3,+2\rangle$ or $|2,+2\rangle$, switching the polarization of the excitation from co to cross circular produces a change of the PL intensity with two transients: first, an abrupt PL increase (or decrease), reflecting the population change of the observed spin-polarized charged excitons; then a slower transient with a characteristic time of a few tens of nanoseconds, depending on the laser excitation power.
	
	The progressive decrease of the resonant PL intensity is the signature of an optical pumping of the hole-Mn spin: the hole-Mn state which is optically addressed is partially emptied when the population is ejected out of the excited $\Lambda$ system. As presented in Fig.~\ref{AllPumpB0}, this pumping signal is not sensitive to a longitudinal magnetic field B$_z$ except for an excitation of $|3,\pm1\rangle$ where a significant intensity difference between co and cross circular polarization is only observed under a weak B$_z$.

	\label{PumpExpBPw}
	\end{figure}
	
	The speed of the optical pumping increases with the excitation intensity. This is presented in Fig.~\ref{PumpExpBPw} (a) in the case of a resonant excitation of $|3,\pm2\rangle$ with alternate circular polarization. At high excitation intensity, the pumping time saturates to a value similar to the width of the bunching signal observed in the auto-correlation measurements.
	
	As observed for the auto-correlation, the resonant pumping signal is also strongly sensitive to a transverse magnetic field. Under a weak transverse field (see Fig.~\ref{PumpExpBPw} (b)), we first observe an increase of the speed of the pumping together with a decrease of the amplitude of the signal when the transient time reaches the time resolution of the set-up (around 10 ns). For a large transverse field (B$_\perp$=0.42T), the co and cross circularly polarized resonant PL intensities are identical (see the inset of Fig.~\ref{PumpExpBPw} (b)) and similar pumping transients are observed when switching from $\sigma_{co}$ to $\sigma_{cross}$ or from $\sigma_{cross}$ to $\sigma_{co}$ circular polarization.

The inset presents the variation of the ratio $\Delta I/I$ as a function of $\tau_{dark}$. The solid line is an exponential fit with $\tau_{relax} = 80 ns$.}
	\label{PumpExpDark}
	\end{figure}
	
	To observe the relaxation of the prepared non–equilibrium distribution of the hole-Mn spins, the circularly polarized pump laser is switched off during a dark time $\tau_{dark}$. The amplitude of the pumping transient which appears after $\tau_{dark}$ depends on the hole-Mn spin relaxation. A dark time of 50 ns is enough to observe the reappearance of a significant pumping transient (Fig.~\ref{PumpExpDark}). For comparison and for a better sensitivity of the measurement, the pumping transient observed in the absence of initial preparation of the hole-Mn spin (i.e. when switching of the circular polarization during the dark time) is also presented (red trace in Fig.~\ref{PumpExpDark}). The normalized difference of the amplitude of these two transients, $\Delta I/I$, as a function of $\tau_{dark}$ is presented in the inset of Fig.\ref{PumpExpDark}. This measurement shows that, when the optical excitation is off, it takes around 80 ns to the hole-Mn spin to come back to the ground state of the excited $\Lambda$ system.

	If the optical pumping was storing the hole-Mn spin in the branch of the $\Lambda$ system which is not optically excited, its characteristic time would be controlled by the exciton radiative lifetime and the generation rate. With a hole-Mn relaxation time in the 100 ns range, as observed experimentally, the pumping should take place within a few nanoseconds.

	Another source of spin pumping can be the leak outside the resonantly excited $\Lambda$ system. In this case, the speed of the pumping is controlled by the leakage time and, as observed experimentally, the pumping time is similar to the width of the photon bunching signal. This mechanism of pumping for the hole-Mn spin is confirmed by the transverse magnetic field dependence. The acceleration of the optical pumping in transverse magnetic field (Fig.~\ref{PumpExpBPw} (b)) has the same origin as the decrease of the width of the bunching signal. By mixing the different electron-Mn states, the transverse field enhances the leakage probability out of the resonantly driven $\Lambda$ system and decreases the corresponding optical pumping time.
	
		\subsection{Relaxation mechanism\label{RelaxMech}}
	
			\subsubsection*{Hole-Mn flip-flops mediated by a lattice deformation}		
		
		The observed large resonant PL amplitude of X$^+$-Mn and its dynamics can be qualitatively explained if a fast (nanosecond) and efficient spin transfer mechanism connects the two hole-Mn ground states of each $\Lambda$ system, noted $\tau_{ff}$. We propose a mechanism for the hole-Mn flip-flop at low temperature resulting from a deformation induced exchange interaction~\cite{ExcSpinRelaxQD,ExcSpinDecay}. We show here that hole-Mn states are efficiently coupled via the interplay of their exchange interaction and the lattice deformation induced heavy-hole/light-hole mixing. We will focus in the following on the two hole-Mn states $|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle$ and $|+\frac{5}{2};\Downarrow_h\rangle$ in the ground states of the $\Lambda$ system associated with the electron-Mn levels $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|2,+2\rangle$. Similar results could be obtained with the hole-Mn ground states of the other $\Lambda$ systems.

	First, let us notice that the non diagonal term of the hole-Mn exchange interaction $\dfrac{I_{hMn}}{2}(S^+J^-+S^-J^+)$ couples the heavy-holes ($\Uparrow_h,\Downarrow_h)$ and light-holes $(\uparrow_h,\downarrow_h)$ levels split by $\Delta_{lh}$ through a hole-Mn flip-flop. We consider this interaction as a perturbation on the Mn heavy-hole level structure given by $I_{hMn}S_zJ_z$. 
	As presented in
Sec.~I.1.5, we can rewrite the two perturbed ground states of the $\Lambda$ system considered here $\widetilde{|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle}$ and $\widetilde{|+\frac{5}{2};\Downarrow_h\rangle}$ as:	
	\begin{align}
		\widetilde{|+\frac{5}{2};\Downarrow_h\rangle}=|+\frac{5}{2};\Downarrow_h\rangle-\frac{\sqrt{15}}{2}\frac{I_{hMn}}{\Delta_{lh}}|+\frac{3}{2};\downarrow_h\rangle\nonumber\\
\widetilde{|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle}=|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle-\frac{\sqrt{15}}{2}\frac{I_{hMn}}{\Delta_{lh}}|+\frac{5}{2};\uparrow_h\rangle
	\end{align}
where we neglect the exchange energy shifts of the hole-Mn levels much smaller than $\Delta_{lh}$.

	Phonon-induced deformations comes into play via the off-diagonal terms of the Bir-Pikus Hamiltonian ${\cal H}_{BP}$, describing the influence of strain on the valence band, as written in %Eq.~\ref{BPHamil}
	Eq.~I.24. The parameters $a_{\nu}$, $b$ and $d$ are given in Tab.~\ref{paraph}. The strain produced by phonon vibrations couples the perturbed hole-Mn states $\widetilde{|+5/2\Downarrow_h\rangle}$ and $\widetilde{|+3/2\Uparrow_h\rangle}$ through the Hamiltonian term
	\begin{align}
		\label{int}
		\widetilde{\langle+\frac{5}{2};\Downarrow_h|}H_{BP}\widetilde{|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle}=2\times(-\frac{\sqrt{15}}{2}\frac{I_{hMn}}{\Delta_{lh}})\times R^*
	\end{align}
with
	\begin{align}
		\label{P}
		R=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}b(\epsilon_{xx}-\epsilon_{yy})-id\epsilon_{xy}
	\end{align}
a deformation dependent non-diagonal term of ${\cal H}_{BP}$~\cite{ExcSpinRelaxQD,ExcSpinDecay}. The coupling of the hole-Mn states is a result of an interplay between the hole-Mn exchange interaction and the deformation: neither the exchange interaction nor the deformation perturbation alone can couple these states.

	According to Eq.~\ref{int}, an effective Hamiltonian describing the discussed interaction mechanism with phonons in the subspace $\{|+\frac{5}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle,|+\frac{5}{2};\Downarrow_h\rangle, |+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle,|+\frac{3}{2};\Downarrow_h\rangle\}$  is
	\begin{align}
		\label{Hint}
		H_{int}=-\sqrt{15}\frac{I_{hMn}}{\Delta_{lh}}R^*|+\frac{5}{2};\Downarrow_h\rangle\langle+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h|+H.c
	\end{align}

	The spin decay rates from $|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle$ to $|+\frac{5}{2};\Downarrow_h\rangle$ accompanied by the emission of an acoustic phonon is then given by Fermi's golden rule
	\begin{align}
		\label{fermi}
		\tau^{-1}&=\frac{2\pi}{\hbar}\sum_{k}\left|\langle+\frac{5}{2};\Downarrow_h;\psi;n_k+1|H_{int}|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h;\psi;n_k\rangle\right|^2 \times \delta(\hbar\omega_0-\hbar\omega_{k})
	\end{align}
where $\hbar\omega_0$ is the energy splitting between $|+\frac{5}{2};\Downarrow_h\rangle$ and $|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle$, $n_k$ the number of phonons in mode $k$ and $\psi$ the orbital part of the hole wave function.

	To evaluate the matrix element in Eq.~\ref{fermi} we use the strain tensor components $\epsilon_{ij}$ given by
	\begin{align}
		\label{eps}
		\epsilon_{ij}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial u_i}{\partial r_j}+\frac{\partial u_j}{\partial r_i}\right)
	\end{align}
where $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r})$ is the local displacement field. For an acoustic phonon, the quantized displacement field can be written in the real space~\cite{ExcSpinDecay,ManyPartPhys}:
	\begin{align}
		\label{u}
		\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{r})=i\sum_{k,\lambda}\sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2\rho\omega_{k,\lambda}N\nu_0}}\mathbf{e}_{k,\lambda}(b_{k,\lambda}+b^\dag_{-k,\lambda})\exp({i\mathbf{k}\mathbf{r}})
	\end{align}
where N is the number of unit cells in the crystal, $\nu_0$ is the volume of a cell and $\rho$ the mass density. $b^\dag_{k,\lambda}$ ($b_{k,\lambda}$) is the creation (annihilation) operator of phonon in the mode $(k,\lambda)$ of energy $\hbar\omega_{k,\lambda}$ and unit polarization vector $\mathbf{e}_{k,\lambda}$. In zinc-blend crystals there are two transverse acoustic phonon branches $\lambda=t_1, t_2$ and one longitudinal acoustic phonon branch $\lambda=l$. The polarization vectors of these phonons branches are given by \cite{hSpinRelax}:
	\begin{align}
		\label{k}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			\mathbf{e}_{k,l}=&\dfrac{\mathbf{k}}{k}=\dfrac{1}{k}(k_x,k_y,k_z)\\
			\mathbf{e}_{k,t_1}=&\dfrac{1}{kk_{\bot}}(k_xk_z,k_yk_z,-k_{\bot}^2)\\
			\mathbf{e}_{k,t_2}=&\dfrac{1}{k_{\bot}}(k_y,-k_x,0)
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
with $k_{\bot}=\sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2}$.

	Upon substitutions given by Eq.~\ref{eps}, \ref{u} and \ref{k}, we obtain for the matrix element in Eq.\ref{fermi}:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			|M_{k,\lambda}|^2=& 15\left(\dfrac{I_{hMn}}{\Delta_{lh}}\right)^2\dfrac{\hbar}{2\rho\omega_{k,\lambda}N\nu_0}\left(n_B(\omega_{k,\lambda})+1\right) \\
			& \times \left(\dfrac{3b^2}{4}(k_xe_{x,\lambda}-k_ye_{y,\lambda})^2+\dfrac{d^2}{4}(k_xe_{y,\lambda}+k_ye_{x,\lambda})^2\right) \times |\mathcal{F}_{\lambda}(\mathbf{k})|^2
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
with
	\begin{align}
	\mathcal{F}_{\lambda}(\mathbf{k})=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}d^3r\psi^*(\mathbf{r})\exp({i \mathbf{k} \mathbf{r}} \psi(\mathbf{r}))
	\end{align}
and $n_B(\omega_{k,\lambda})=
1/(e^{\hbar\omega_{k,\lambda}/K_BT}-1)$, the thermal phonon distribution function.

	For a Gaussian hole wave function with in-plane and z-direction parameters $l_{\bot}$ and $l_z$ respectively (full width at half maximum $2\sqrt{2\ln2}l_i$)
	\begin{align}
		\psi(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{\pi^{3/4}l_{\bot} \sqrt{l_z}} \exp \left(-\frac{1}{2} \left(\left( \frac{r_{\bot}}{l_{\bot}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{z}{l_z} \right)^2 \right)\right)
	\end{align}
the form factor $\mathcal{F}_{\lambda}(\mathbf{k})$, which is the Fourier transform of $|\psi(\mathbf{r})|^2$, becomes
	\begin{align}
	\mathcal{F}_{\lambda}(\mathbf{k})=\exp\left( -\frac{1}{4} \left(\left(l_{\bot} k_{\bot} \right)^2 + \left(l_z k_z \right)^2 \right)\right)
	\end{align}
	
	Considering a linear dispersion of acoustic phonons $\omega_{k,\lambda}=c_{\lambda}k$ and in spherical coordinates with $\mathbf{k}=k(\sin\theta\cos\varphi,\sin\theta\sin\varphi,\cos\theta)$, the explicit formula of the decay rate Eq.~\ref{fermi} is
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			 \tau^{-1}=& \sum_{\lambda}\dfrac{15}{(2\pi)^2}\left(\dfrac{I_{hMn}}{\Delta_{lh}}\right)^2\left(\dfrac{\omega_0}{c_{\lambda}}\right)^3\dfrac{1}{2\hbar\rho c_{\lambda}^2}\dfrac{\pi}{4}\left(3b^2+d^2\right) \\
 					& \times \left(n_B(\omega_0)+1)\right)\int_0^{\pi}d\theta\sin\theta|\mathcal{F}_{\lambda}(\omega_0,\theta)|^2G_{\lambda}(\theta)
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
where we used the continuum limit ($\sum_k\rightarrow V/(2\pi)^3\int d^3k$ with $V=N\nu_0$ the crystal volume) and integrated over $k$ and $\varphi$. The summation is taken over the acoustic phonon branches $\lambda$ of corresponding sound velocity $c_{\lambda}$. The geometrical form factors for each phonon branch, $G_{\lambda}(\theta)$, are given by
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			G_{l}(\theta)=& \sin^4\theta \\
			G_{t_1}(\theta)=& \sin^2\theta\cos^2\theta \\
			G_{t_2}(\theta)=&\sin^2\theta

	{\begin{center}

	\end{center}}
	\end{figure}
	
	In the numerical calculation of the spin flip time $\tau_{ff}$ presented in Fig.\ref{TauRelax} we use the material parameters of CdTe or ZnTe and the typical parameters for self-assembled CdTe/ZnTe QDs listed in Table \ref{paraph}. The calculated relaxation time strongly depend on the energy separation between the hole-Mn levels $\hbar\omega_0$. This energy dependence is controlled by the size of the hole wave-function given by $l_{\bot}$ and $sl_z$. The estimated flip-flop time is also strongly sensitive on the exchange induced mixing of the ground heavy-hole states with the higher energy light-hole levels. In our model, this mixing is controlled by $\Delta_{lh}$, an effective energy splitting between heavy-holes and light-holes. This simple parameter can indeed describe more complex effects such as a coupling of the confined heavy-hole with ground state light-holes in the barriers \cite{Couplinghhlhbarrier} or effective reduction of heavy-hole/light-hole splitting due to a presence of a dense manifold of heavy-hole like QD states lying between the confined heavy-hole and light-hole levels \cite{Supercouplinghhlh}. From this modelling we deduce that for a hole confined in small Cd$_x$Zn$_{1-x}$Te alloy QDs, the hole-Mn flip-flop time $\tau_{ff}$ can be easily bellow 2 ns for an effective heavy-hole/light-hole splitting $\Delta_{lh}=15$ meV and an energy separation in the meV range, typical for the hole-Mn spin splitting in magnetic QDs. We will use in the following calculations $\tau_{ff}=1.5$ ns for the ground states of each $\Lambda$ system.
	
		\subsubsection*{Model of the carrier-Mn spin dynamics under resonant excitation}
	
	Using the level scheme presented in Fig.~\ref{CompleteEnerStruct} (a) for a positively charged Mn-doped QD and the estimated hole-Mn flip-flop rates, we can calculate the time evolution of the $24 \times 24$ density matrix $\varrho$ describing the population and the coherence of the 12 electron-Mn states on the excited state and the 12 hole-Mn states on the ground state of a positively charged QD. In the Markovian approximation, the master equation which governs the evolution of $\varrho$ can be written in a general form (Lindblad form) as:	
	\begin{align}
		\label{Lindblad}
		\frac{\partial\varrho}{\partial t}=\frac{-i}{\hbar}[{\cal H},\varrho]+L\varrho
	\end{align}
where ${\cal H}$ is the Hamiltonian of the complete system (X$^+$-Mn, ${\cal H}_{X^+Mn}$, and hole-Mn, ${\cal H}_{hMn}$):
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rll}
			{\cal H}_{X^+Mn} =& I_{eMn} \mathbf{S}\cdot\bm{\upsigma} - 2\eta S_z^2 &+ D_0S^2_z+E(S_y^2-S_x^2) \\
													 & &+ g_{Mn} \mu_B \mathbf{S} \cdot \mathbf{B} + g_{e} \mu_B \bm{\upsigma}\cdot\mathbf{B}
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
and
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rll}
			{\cal H}_{hMn} =& I_{hMn} \mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{J} - \eta S_z^2 &+ D_0S^2_z+E(S_y^2-S_x^2) \\
																& &+ g_{Mn} \mu_B \mathbf{S}\cdot\mathbf{B} + g_{h} \mu_B \mathbf{J}\cdot\mathbf{B}
		\end{array}
	\end{align}

	In Eq.~\ref{Lindblad}, $L\varrho$ describes the coupling or decay channels resulting from an
interaction with the environment~\cite{SpinQJumps, ephBroad, MnResSpinDyn}. The population transfers from level $j$ to level $i$ in an irreversible process associated with a coupling to a reservoir is described by a Lindblad term of the form
	\begin{align}
		\label{inc}
		L_{inc,j\rightarrow i}\varrho=\frac{\Gamma_{j\rightarrow i}}{2}(2|i\rangle\langle j|\varrho|j\rangle\langle i| -\varrho|j\rangle\langle j|-|j\rangle\langle j|\varrho)
	\end{align}
where $\Gamma_{j\rightarrow i}$ is the incoherent relaxation rate from level $j$ to level $i$. Such term can describe the radiative decay of the exciton (irreversible coupling to the photon modes) or the relaxation of the carriers or Mn spin (irreversible coupling to the phonon modes). It can also be used to describe the optical generation of an exciton in the low excitation regime where the energy shift induced by the coupling with the laser field is neglected.

	A pure dephasing (i.e. not related to an exchange of energy with a reservoir) can also be introduced for the different spins and described by $L_{deph,jj}\varrho$:
	\begin{align}
		\label{deph}
		L_{deph,jj}\varrho=\frac{\gamma_{jj}}{2}(2|j\rangle\langle j|\varrho|j\rangle\langle j| -\varrho|j\rangle\langle j|-|j\rangle\langle j|\varrho)
	\end{align}
where $\gamma_{jj}$ is the pure dephasing rate of level $j$.

	To identify the main spin relaxation channels responsible for the observed spin fluctuations, we first modelled the auto-correlation of the resonant PL using the full spin level structure of a p-doped magnetic QD. For a qualitative description of the observed spin dynamics, we use as an example the Mn-doped QD parameters extracted from the linear polarization intensity map listed in Tab.~\ref{paraQD} and reasonable order of magnitude for the spin relaxation times.

	As already observed in charged Mn-doped QDs under pulsed resonant excitation~\cite{VybornyMagAnisQDs}, we consider that the spin dynamics in the excited state is controlled by the time evolution of ${\cal H}_{X^+Mn}$, the generation rate of excitons $\gamma_g=1/\tau_g$ and their radiative lifetime $\tau_r=0.3$ ns. The coherence of the coupled electron-Mn spins is limited by a pure dephasing term $T_2^{eMn}=0.5$ ns, extracted from the time resolved PL (see Sec.~\ref{StrainInfl}).

	For the hole-Mn system in the ground state, we take into account a spin relaxation time of the Mn in the exchange field of the hole, $\tau_{Mn}$, describing relaxation channels involving a change of the Mn spin by one unit. This spin relaxation channel is introduced for a general description, however its characteristic time (in the $\mu$s range) is long compared to the time-scale of the dynamics considered in the resonant PL experiments and does not qualitatively affect the calculated time evolution.

	Because of the presence of valence band mixing in the QDs, spin flip of the hole independently of the Mn are expected to be more efficient. A spin flip time in the 10 ns range has indeed been calculated for a hole in the exchange field of a Mn~\cite{CaoSpinPhonCoupl,OptOrientMn}. Relaxation time of the hole spin around 5 ns has also been measured at zero magnetic field in negatively charged CdTe/ZnTe QDs~\cite{LeGallElecNuclDyn}. We then include in the model possible spin flips of the hole by one unit with a characteristic time $\tau_{h}$=10ns. The phonon induced hole-Mn flip-flops, occurring at $\tau_{ff}$, are also introduced between the two hole-Mn ground states of each $\Lambda$ system.

	For a general qualitative description, an additional pure dephasing time $T_2^{hMn}$ is also included in the dynamics of the hole-Mn system with a Lindblad term of the form (Eq.~\ref{deph}). We cannot extract this parameter from the experiments. We take $T_2^{hMn}= 5 ns$, slightly longer than what was measured for electron-Mn, as the hole-Mn system is highly split and less sensitive to effective fluctuating magnetic field such as the one produced by nuclear spins for instance~\cite{LeGallElecNuclDyn,SingleHolePopTrap}.
	
	The transition rates $\Gamma_{\gamma\rightarrow\gamma'}$ between the different hole-Mn states depend on their energy separation $E_{\gamma\gamma'}=E_{\gamma'}-E_{\gamma}$. Here we use $\Gamma_{\gamma\rightarrow\gamma'}=1/\tau_{i}$ if $E_{\gamma\gamma'}<0$ and $\Gamma_{\gamma\rightarrow\gamma'}=1/\tau_{i}e^{-E_{\gamma\gamma'}/k_BT}$ if $E_{\gamma\gamma'}>0$~\cite{PhotoSpinOrient,CaoSpinPhonCoupl}. This accounts for a thermalization among the 12 hole-Mn levels with an effective spin temperature $T$. The optical excitation ($\tau_g$), the exciton recombination ($\tau_r$), the Mn spin relaxation ($\tau_{Mn}$), the hole spin relaxation ($\tau_{h}$) and the phonon induced transfer time ($\tau_{ff}$) produce an irreversible population transfer between level $\gamma$ and $\gamma'$ and are described by Lindblad terms (Eq.~\ref{inc}).

	To model the auto-correlation of the $\sigma-$ PL intensity of the electron-Mn state $|3;+2\rangle$ under CW $\sigma+$ resonant excitation we calculate the time evolution of $\rho_{|+\frac{3}{2};\uparrow_e\rangle}(t)$ with the initial condition $\rho_{|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle}(0)=1$ corresponding to the hole-Mn spin in the state $|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle$ just after the emission of a $\sigma-$ photon on the low energy branch of the $\Lambda$ system. This initial state is a slight approximation: in the presence of valence band mixing, the two ground states of a given $\Lambda$ system are not completely pure hole-Mn spin states but are slightly coupled by a hole-Mn flip-flop induced by the exchange interaction ${\cal H}_{hMn}^{ex}$. However, as the splitting between the states $|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle$ and $|+\frac{5}{2};\Downarrow_h\rangle$ ($\Delta=4\times3/2I_{hMn}$) is large compared with the coupling term ($W=\sqrt{15}\frac{\rho_c}{\Delta_{lh}}I_{hMn}$), their coherent coupling is weak. With a large valence band mixing $\frac{\rho_c}{\Delta_{lh}}=0.1$ as observed in the dot discussed in this paper, this leads for the hole-Mn system initialized in the state $|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle$ to a fast oscillation of the population between the two corresponding hole-Mn ground states of the $\Lambda$ system with a maximum amplitude of about 1.6\% and an average population transfer efficiency of 0.8\%~\cite{CohenTannoudji}. Under resonant excitation on the high energy branch of the the $\Lambda$ system, the QD remains OFF more than 99$\%$ of the time. As we will see in the following, the contribution of this weak coherent population transfer to the calculated auto-correlation signal is not significant.

	$\rho_{|+\frac{3}{2};\uparrow_e\rangle}(t)$ obtained with the QD parameters listed in Tab.~\ref{paraQD} is presented in Fig.~\ref{AutocorModBPw} (a). This quantity has to be normalized by $\rho_{|+\frac{3}{2};\uparrow_e\rangle}(\infty)$) to directly account for the autocorrelation signal. After a fast increase, the calculated population presents a maximum at short delay. This model is based on a large number of parameters, whose values cannot all be extracted precisely from the measurements however, with reasonable spin relaxation parameters (see details in the caption of Fig.~\ref{AutocorModBPw}), the width and the amplitude of the maximum are in good agreement with the photon bunching signals observed experimentally.

	The width of the calculated bunching is controlled by all the spin-flip terms that can induce an escape out of the resonantly excited $\Lambda$ system. At zero transverse magnetic field, it is dominated by spin flips in the hole-Mn system. As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{AutocorModBPw} (a), suppressing $\tau_h$ gives a width of bunching only controlled by the Hamiltonian evolution and the decoherence which is slightly larger than what is observed experimentally (Fig.~\ref{AutocorExpBPw}).

	The dependence on the excitation intensity, $\tau_g$, and transverse magnetic field, $B_{\perp}$, are also qualitatively well reproduced by the model (Fig.~\ref{AutocorModBPw} (c) and (d) respectively). At zero magnetic field, the leaks outside the excited $\Lambda$ systems are dominated by $\tau_h$. $\mathcal{H}_{X^+Mn}$ induces fluctuations in a slightly longer time scale. The situation is different under a weak transverse magnetic field where the electron-Mn states are mixed introducing new channel of escape and significantly reducing the width of the photon bunching (See Fig.~\ref{AutocorExpBPw} for the corresponding experiments).

	Let us note that suppressing the fast flip-flop process connecting the two hole-Mn ground states ($\tau_{ff}=\infty$ in Fig.~\ref{AutocorModBPw} (b)) still produces a bunching as with the approximated initial condition used in the calculation ($\rho_{|+\frac{3}{2};\Uparrow_h\rangle}(0)=1$) a weak coherent transfer between the two ground states of the $\Lambda$ system still exist. However, with this process only, the calculated PL intensity is always more than 50 times smaller than with $\tau_{ff}$ and its contribution to the calculated auto-correlation signal (Fig.~\ref{AutocorModBPw} (a)) can be safely neglected.

	\label{PumpModBPw}
	\end{figure}
	
	With this model, we can also calculate the population of the electron-Mn states under resonant excitation with alternated circular polarization and estimate the efficiency and dynamics of the optical pumping. Fig.~\ref{PumpModBPw} presents the calculated time evolution of the population of the electron-Mn state $|+\frac{3}{2},\uparrow_e\rangle$ under alternated resonant excitation of $|3,+2\rangle$ in $\sigma+$ polarization or $|3,-2\rangle$ in $\sigma-$ polarization. This corresponds to the experimental configuration where the QD is resonantly excited with modulated circular polarization at the energy of $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|3,-2\rangle$ (absorption (2) in Fig.~\ref{LambdaLevel} (b)) and the low energy resonant PL is detected in $\sigma-$ polarisation. The main features of the time-resolved optical pumping experiments (see Fig.~\ref{AllPumpB0} and Fig.~\ref{PumpExpBPw}) are well reproduced by the model. The timescale of the pumping transient, in the few tens of nanosecond range, and its excitation intensity dependence are also in good agrement with the experiments (see Fig.~\ref{PumpModBPw} (a)).

	The influence of a transverse magnetic field, B$_{\perp}$, on the optical pumping transient can also be described by this model. First, a significant reduction of the pumping time is observed for a weak magnetic field (B$_{\perp}=0.2$ T in Fig.~\ref{PumpModBPw}(b)). As for the autocorrelation, this acceleration comes from the increase of the leakage out of the $\Lambda$ system induced by the mixing of the electron-Mn states. Secondly, the transients obtained when switching the polarization from $\sigma_{co}$ to $\sigma_{cross}$ and from $\sigma_{cross}$ to $\sigma_{co}$ become identical for B$_{\perp}\approx0.4$T, as observed in the experiments (Fig.~\ref{PumpExpBPw} (b)).

	To understand this behaviour under B$_{\perp}$, let us remember that we resonantly excite $|3,+2\rangle$ from $|+\frac{5}{2},\Downarrow_h\rangle$ with $\sigma+$ light and excite $|3,-2\rangle$ from $|-\frac{5}{2},\Uparrow_h\rangle$ with $\sigma-$ photons. In both cases we detect the population of $|+\frac{3}{2},\uparrow_e\rangle$ in $\sigma-$ polarization (see the excitation/detection configuration illustrated in the inset of Fig.~\ref{AllPumpB0} (b)). If the states $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|3,-2\rangle$ are uncoupled, as it is the case at zero field, we do not detect any light during the $\sigma-$ excitation. With a sufficiently large mixing of $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|3,-2\rangle$ induced by the transverse magnetic field, for a $\sigma-$ excitation of $|3,-2\rangle$, the population can be coherently transferred to $|3,+2\rangle$ during the charged exciton lifetime and $\sigma-$ light is detected after a recombination towards $|+\frac{3}{2},\Uparrow_h\rangle$ (see Sec.~\ref{StrainInfl}). In the optical pumping sequence, we can then observe, in $\sigma-$ polarization, a transient when the $\sigma+$ excitation empties the state $|+\frac{5}{2},\Downarrow_h\rangle$ but also a similar transient when the $\sigma-$ excitation empties the state $|-\frac{5}{2},\Uparrow_h\rangle$. The transverse magnetic field dependence of the difference of steady state intensity observed in $\sigma_{co}$ and $\sigma_{cross}$ polarization (inset of Fig.~\ref{PumpExpBPw} (b)) is also well reproduced by the model (inset of Fig.~\ref{PumpModBPw} (b)). This depolarization curve is controlled by the anisotropy of the electron-Mn spin which is induced by $\eta$ and $D_0$~\cite{DynhMn}. Let us note finally that, as expected, suppressing $\tau_{ff}$ from the model, a very weak average resonant PL and a fast optical pumping are obtained (Fig.~\ref{PumpModBPw} (a), top curve).

	Including a dark time in the pumping sequence, we can also numerically evaluate the time required for the hole-Mn spin to return to the ground state of the excited $\Lambda$ system. The time evolution of the population of the hole-Mn state $|+5/2,\Downarrow_h\rangle$ initially prepared by a sequence of $\sigma-$/$\sigma+$ excitation resonant with $|3;+2\rangle$ (and $|3;-2\rangle$) is presented in Fig.~\ref{PumpModDark}. When the optical excitation is switched off, after an abrupt jump due to the optical recombination of the charge exciton, the ground hole-Mn state $|+5/2,\Downarrow_h\rangle$ is repopulated in a timescale of about 100 ns, much shorter than the Mn spin relaxation time used in the model ($\tau_{Mn}=5$ ns). This relaxation is induced by the presence of valence band mixing. In the presence of valence-band mixing, $\mathcal{H}_{hMn}^{ex}$ couples two by two the different hole-Mn levels. This coupling induces a transfer of population between the different hole-Mn levels. The transfer of population becomes irreversible in the presence of dephasing and controls the observed hole-Mn spin relaxation~\cite{DynhMn}.

	The particular behaviour observed for a resonant excitation of the electron-Mn states $|3,+1\rangle$ or $|3,-1\rangle$ (weak photon bunching and no optical pumping at zero field, Fig.~\ref{AllAutocorB0} (a) and Fig.~\ref{AllPumpB0} (a) respectively) is also qualitatively explained by the model (see Fig.~\ref{StrainAutocorPump}). The $|3,+1\rangle$ and $|3,-1\rangle$ states are degenerated and differ by a change of angular momentum of two. Consequently, they are efficiently mixed by the anisotropic strain term $E(S_y^2-S_x^2)$ which induces a spin-flip of two of the Mn with a conservation of the electron spin. This coupling has no significant influence on the other e-Mn states which are initially split by $D_0 S_z^2$ and $-2\eta S_z^2$.
	
	The splitting between the two new eigenstates, formed by the mixing of $|3,+1\rangle$ and $|3,-1\rangle$, in the $\mu$eV range, is much weaker than width of the resonant laser used in our experiments (around 10 $\mu$eV) and the width of the optical transitions (around 50 $\mu$eV). Under circularly polarized resonant excitation we either excite $|3,+1\rangle$ with $\sigma+$ photons or $|3,-1\rangle$ with $\sigma-$ photons. 
	%At zero magnetic field, the population is transferred between the two states in a time scale of a few hundreds picoseconds (see Sec.~\ref{StrainInfl}).
	Under circularly polarized resonant excitation, the two $\Lambda$ systems associated with $|3,\pm1\rangle$ are simultaneously excited. For alternated circular polarization, a steady state is reached and no pumping transient induced by a leak outside the $\Lambda$ systems is expected. Under a weak longitudinal magnetic field the Mn Zeeman energy dominates the strain anisotropy term and the coherent transfer is blocked. The states $|3,+1\rangle$ and $|3,-1\rangle$ are decoupled and a large amplitude of bunching and an efficient optical pumping are restored. This behaviour observed in the experiments is qualitatively reproduced by the model.

	Let us finally note that in the modelling of optical pumping at zero magnetic field presented in Fig.~\ref{StrainAutocorPump} (b), fast oscillations are obtained in the first nanoseconds after the polarization switching. These are due to the population transfer between $|3,+1\rangle$ and $|3,-1\rangle$ in the excited state (directly coupled by $E$) during the coherence time. These oscillations are too fast to be observed in the experiments. The calculated resonant PL intensity in $\sigma-$ polarization (proportional to $\rho_{|+\frac{1}{2},\uparrow_e\rangle}$) is also slightly larger for a $\sigma+$ excitation than for a $\sigma-$ excitation. The $\sigma-$ resonant PL probes the population of $|3,+1\rangle$ which is directly excited by a resonant $\sigma+$ laser (see the excitation/detection configuration in the inset of Fig.~\ref{AllPumpB0} (a)). On the other hand, under a $\sigma-$ laser, one excites $|3,-1\rangle$ and the charged exciton has a probability to recombine before being transferred to $|3,+1\rangle$ and detected in $\sigma-$ PL. This transfer time results in a slight difference in the steady state resonant PL intensity obtained in a $\sigma_{Co}$ or $\sigma_{Cross}$ configuration (see Fig.~\ref{AllPumpB0} (a)).

	We saw in those last paragraphs that the strain anisotropy is important to take into account for the dynamic of the e-Mn states $|3, \pm1 \rangle$. It prevents the system to be pump on those states in the absence of longitudinal magnetic field. This batting between the states $|3, +1\rangle$ and $|3, -1\rangle$ can be used to extract the value of the QD strain anisotropy. We will study how in the next section.

	\section{Influence of the strain anisotropy\label{StrainInfl}}
	
	We exploited the $\Lambda$-level structure evidenced in Sec.~\ref{LambdaId} to analyze the coherent dynamics of the e-Mn spin through the time evolution of the circular polarization rate, $\kappa = (\sigma_{Cross} - \sigma_{Co}) / (\sigma_{Cross} + \sigma_{Co})$, of the resonant PL. The configuration of the experiment is summarized in Fig.~\ref{PolarRateTotal} (a). Circularly polarized and spectrally filtered 10 ps laser pulses are successively tuned on resonance with the high energy lines of the $\Lambda$-system associated with the the e-Mn states $|3,+1\rangle$, $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|2,+2\rangle$. The QD is excited with sequences of $\sigma+$/$\sigma-$ pulses (Fig.~\ref{PolarRateTotal} (b)), to avoid any possible optical spin pumping of h-Mn~\cite{DynhMn} that could influence the observed dynamics.

	\label{PolarRateTotal}
	\end{figure}
	
	The main result is the observation of an oscillatory behaviour of the polarization rate of the PL when probing the dynamics of the $|3,+1\rangle$ state. The period of the beats is 270 ps with a characteristic damping time of 0.6 ns. When probing the dynamics of the $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|2,+2\rangle$ states, we measured cross circularly polarized PL with a slow decrease of the polarization rate during the lifetime of X$^+$-Mn.
	
	The origin of this dynamics lies in the mixing of the $|3,+1\rangle$ and $|3,-1\rangle$ states by the anisotropy of strain, as presented in Sec.~\ref{RelaxMech}. When a pulsed laser is tuned to the high energy transition of the $\Lambda$ system associated to $|3,+1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(\sqrt{4}|+1/2,\uparrow_e\rangle+\sqrt{2}|+3/2,\downarrow_e\rangle)$ ($\sigma+$ absorption from the h-Mn state $|+3/2, \Downarrow_h\rangle$), the PL of the low energy transition of the $\Lambda$ system is first cross-circularly polarized ($\sigma-$ recombination to the h-Mn state $|+1/2, \Uparrow_h\rangle$). Then, after a coherent transfer of population to the e-Mn state $|3,-1\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} (\sqrt{2} |-3/2, \uparrow_e\rangle + \sqrt{4} |-1/2\, \downarrow_e\rangle)$ induced by $E$ (Fig.\ref{PolarRateTotal} (c)), co-circularly polarized PL is emitted at the same energy from the $|3,-1\rangle$ state ($\sigma+$ recombination to $|-1/2\rangle|\Downarrow\rangle$). This coherent transfer of population is fully controlled by the in-plane anisotropy of the strain at the Mn location and is responsible for the observed oscillations of the circular polarization rate.
	
	To understand the details of this dynamics, we calculated the time evolution of the populations and coherence of the twelve X$^+$-Mn states and the twelve hole-Mn states. We neglected here the hyperfine coupling between the electronic and nuclear spins of the Mn and solved the master equation for the $24 \times 24$ density matrix numerically, including relaxation and pure dephasing processes in the Lindblad form, as presented in Sec.~\ref{RelaxMech}.
	
	For the initial condition in the calculation of the time evolution, we consider that a $\sigma+$ pulse on resonance with the high energy side of the $\Lambda$-level system (1) (see Fig.~\ref{LambdaLevel}) projects the system on the $M=3$ electron-Mn subspace on all the levels that contain a component $|+3/2, \downarrow_e\rangle$. In the absence of transverse magnetic field and strain anisotropy term $E$, this excitation simply corresponds to an optical transition from the hole-Mn state $|+3/2, \Downarrow_h\rangle$ towards the electron-Mn state $|3, +1\rangle$. With a weak transverse magnetic field (typically lower than 0.5 T), a linear combination of the $M=3$ states is created. At large transverse magnetic field, one should consider possible mixing with the $M=2$ states. Similarly, a $\sigma+$ pulse on (2) projects the system on the $M=3$ electron-Mn subspace on the levels that contain a component $|+5/2, \downarrow_e\rangle$ and a $\sigma+$ pulse resonant on (3) projects the system on the $M=2$ electron-Mn subspace on the levels that contain a component $|+5/2, \downarrow_e\rangle$.
	
	After this excitation, the circular polarization of the resonant photoluminescence is governed by the evolution of the spin of the electron. For instance, to compute the circular polarization rate of the emission after a resonant $\sigma+$ excitation on (1) (optical excitation from the hole-Mn state $|+3/2, \Downarrow_h\rangle$ to $|3, +1\rangle$ : high energy branch of the $\Lambda$-system) we calculate the difference between the density matrix elements $\rho_{|+1/2, \uparrow_e\rangle}$ ($\sigma-$ recombination towards the hole-Mn state $|+1/2, \Uparrow_h\rangle$ : low energy branch of the $\Lambda$-system) and $\rho_{|-1/2, \downarrow_e\rangle}$ ($\sigma+$ recombination towards the hole-Mn state $|-1/2, \Downarrow_h\rangle$ : low energy branch of the $\Lambda$-system associated with $|3, -1\rangle$  ).
	
	In the absence of magnetic field, the period of the quantum beats observed for an excitation of $|3,+1\rangle$ depends only on the anisotropy term $E$. The experimental data can be well reproduced by the model with $E=1.8$ $\mu$eV (Fig.\ref{PolarRateTotal} (d)). A coherence time, $T_2^{eMn}\approx0.6$ ns, of the spin of e-Mn is extracted from the damping of the oscillations. For an excitation of $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|2,+2\rangle$ one can observe a slow decrease of the polarization rate which is also qualitatively reproduced by the model.

	The coherent transfer of population depends both on the initial splitting of the e-Mn spin states (controlled at zero field by $D_0$ and $\eta$) and on the strength of the coupling $E$. The splitting between the e-Mn states can be tuned by a magnetic field, $B_z$, applied along the growth axis. In addition, a coupling between the e-Mn spin states $M_z$ can be induced by a magnetic field, $B_x$, applied in the QD plane. The experimental and calculated evolution of the polarization rate of the e-Mn states, $|3,+1\rangle$, $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|2,+2\rangle$, versus magnetic field are presented in Fig.~\ref{hMnPolarRateB}.

	Under a longitudinal magnetic field B$_z$, the e-Mn states $M_z=\pm1$ are split and the influence of $E$ is progressively reduced. For an excitation on the $|3,+1\rangle$ state, the amplitude and period of the oscillations in the polarization rate reduce as $B_z$ increases: the resonant PL becomes cross-circularly polarized with a polarization rate constant during the lifetime of $X^+$. A weak longitudinal magnetic field stabilizes the spin of the e-Mn states $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|2,+2\rangle$ and their polarization rate remains constant during the lifetime of X$^+$-Mn.

	In a transverse magnetic field $B_x$, the quantum beats observed for an excitation of $|3,+1\rangle$ are accelerated and the measured circular polarization rate drops to zero as the period of the oscillations becomes smaller than the time resolution of the experimental setup ($\approx 60$ ps). A given transverse magnetic field induces a slower oscillation of the polarization rate for the states $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|2,+2\rangle$.

	The observed magnetic field dependence of the coherent dynamics of $|3,+1\rangle$, $|3,+2\rangle$ and $|2,+2\rangle$ can be qualitatively reproduced by the model with the exchange parameters deduced from the PL and the strain anisotropy term and coherence time deduced from the oscillations observed on $|3,+1\rangle$ at zero magnetic field (Fig.\ref{PolarRateTotal}). $D_0$ cannot be extracted from these measurements and we use a typical value $D_0=7$ $\mu$eV corresponding to a partial relaxation of the biaxial strain~\cite{DynhMn}. The different precession periods observed for the three states in a given transverse magnetic field are particularly well described.
	
	The calculated evolution of the electron-Mn states energy in magnetic field, both transverse and longitudinal, are presented in Fig.~\ref{hMnPolarRateBMod} for the three $\Lambda$-systems identified. In agreement with the calculated electron-Mn energy levels (Fig.~\ref{PolarRateTotal}), this modelling reveals a significant influence of the orientation of the transverse magnetic field on the electron-Mn coherent dynamics. This behaviour could not be observed with our experimental set-up which did not permit to change the direction of the transverse field while staying on the same Mn-doped QD. A systematic experimental study of the transverse magnetic field effect has still to be realized.
	
	\section*{Conclusion}
	
	We studied in this chapter the details of the energy structure and the dynamics of the Mn in a positively charged quantum dot. We saw that the ground state consists of hole-Mn hybrid spin states, and the excited state is dominated by the e-Mn interaction. This leads to an ensemble of optical $\Lambda$-level systems. This opens the possibility to perform a coherent manipulation of the magnet formed by the coupled h-Mn spins with two resonant optical fields~\cite{SingleHolePopTrap}. We used these systems to study the spin resonant dynamics of positively charged Mn-doped CdTe/ZnTe QD.
	
	Using those, we identified and efficient spin relaxation channel for the hybrid hole-Mn spin in a QD. We propose these hole-Mn flips-flops to be caused by the interplay of the exchange interaction and the lattice deformation of acoustic phonons. The characteristic time of these flip-flops depends on the splitting between the two considered hole-Mn states, and are found in our $\Lambda$-system to be of the nanosecond time scale. This reproduce well the experiments and shows that these flip-flops are responsible for the large PL intensity observed under resonant excitation of of the $\Lambda$-systems. Jumps out of these systems are possible and induce a large bunching in the resonant PL. They also are at the origin of the optical hole-Mn spin observed under circularly polarized resonant excitation. We can enhance the escape out of the excited $\Lambda$ system by applying a transverse magnetic field, mixing the e-Mn states in the excited state of the charged QD. This fast h-Mn dynamic dynamics makes this hybrid spin not ideal for practical use for quantum information device. However, the use of a different QD systems with a better hole confinement and a larger hh-lh splitting could significantly reduce the influence of valence band mixing on the hole-Mn spin relaxation and limit the interaction of the hybrid spin with acoustic phonons.
	
	Another interesting point was found for Mn in positively charged strained quantum dots probing the time dependence of the resonant PL polarization for each $\Lambda$-level system. We saw oscillations in the one associated with the excited state $|3, +1\rangle$ when a stable polarization of the emission was expected. We explained this by a control of the electron and Mn spins coherent dynamics by the strains amplitude and symmetry at the Mn location. These results demonstrate the potential of magnetic QDs where one could exploit the intrinsic spin(strain interaction to coherently couple the spin of a magnetic atom to the motion of a nano-mechanical oscillator~\cite{SensingOscilQuBit, CouplingNVOscill} and suggest some possible coherent mechanical spin-driving of a magnetic atom.
	
	Coupling spins to a mechanical oscillator open new way to manipulate spin. In the next chapter, we will study a system with a non-zero orbital momentum, and thus more strongly coupled to the strain state than the Mn atom: a single Cr atom in a II-VI quantum dot.
	

	







\chapter{Magneto-optical study of Cr-doped CdTe quantum dots\label{MagOptStud}}


	The main goal of this thesis was to include single Cr atoms in CdTe/ZnTe QDs. It was successfully achieved. We saw in Sec.~\ref{CrSemiCon} how the Cr atom is incorporated in II-VI semiconductor. We will now optically study Cr-doped QDs in order to probe the carrier-Cr interactions.
	
	We begin presenting the photoluminescence (PL) and the energy structure of the X-Cr complex. It was sawn that the exchange interaction between the carrier and the Chromium is strong enough to see the effect of a single Cr spin in the quantum dots, giving the PL of the dots four characteristics peaks. We discuss the evolution of the emission in temperature and present different excited states of the system. Magneto-optical experiments confirm the energy structure, and hints at an anti-ferromagnetic between hole and Cr. In the next section, we use the evolution of the QDs PL under magnetic field in order to deduce the QD parameters, using a spin hamiltonian model including the strain induced fine structure of the magnetic atom, the exchange coupling with the carriers and the influence of the reduced symmetry of the QDs on the electron-hole exchange interaction and on the valence band. In the last section, we present dots having the characteristic four peaks PL, but that are not explained by our model. We finish proposing a possible explanation for those dots.


	\section{Strained quantum dots containing an individual X-Cr atom}
	
		\subsection{Energy structure of X-Cr in a quantum dot~\label{CrPres}}
		
		Using the procedure described in the 
		%Sec.~\ref{SKGrowth}
		Sec.~II.1, we randomly incorporated Cr atoms in CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots, adjusting the density of the Cr atoms to be roughly equal to the density of dots, in order to get QDs containing 0, 1 or a few Cr atoms. The photoluminescence (PL) of individual QDs, induced by optical excitation with a dye laser tuned on resonance with an excited state of the dots, is studied by optical micro-spectroscopy.

	\caption{PL of (a) QD1, (b) QD2 and (c) QD3 X-Cr complex at low temperature (T=5K). Inset in (c) presents the PLE map of this QD, showing a sharp quasi-resonant state for an excitation at 2100 meV.}
	\label{SpectraX}
	\end{figure}

	Low temperature (T=5K) PL of the neutral exciton (X-Cr) of several QDs doped with a single Cr are reported in Fig.~\ref{SpectraX}. Characteristics three emission lines are observed, with a fourth, weaker peak on the low energy side. In some QDs, such as QD2 and QD3, the central peak was found to be split. Scanning with an energy tunable laser, we saw that all the peaks share a common quasi-resonant state, where all are at a maximum intensity, as highlighted in the inset of Fig.~\ref{SpectraX}(c). This is an indication that they originate from the same dot. Variations in the relative intensities of the peaks are observed in different dots.

	\caption{Illustration of the energy levels of the ground state (Cr), the bright exciton states ($|\pm1\rangle$) coupled to the spin of a Cr (X-Cr) and dominant PL transitions ($\sigma$+, $\sigma$-). The states $S_z = \pm2$ cannot be populated through thermalization, and thus their recombination channel are not shown on this schema.}
	\label{CrEnergyStruct}
	\end{figure}

	In a II-VI semiconductor, the orbital momentum of the Cr connects the spin of the atom to its local strain environment through the modification of the crystal field and the spin-orbit coupling. For biaxial strain in the (001) plane, the ground state of a Cr spin is split by a strain induced magnetic anisotropy term ${\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon_\parallel}=D_0S^2_z$ (see Sec.~\ref{CrSemiCon}). It was deduced from electron paramagnetic resonance of bulk Cr-doped CdTe that $D_0$ is positive for compressive biaxial strain~\cite{EPRCr}. In a self-assembled CdTe/ZnTe QDs with large in-plane strain, the Cr spin energy levels are split from $|S_z=0\rangle$ at low energy (Fig.~\ref{CrEnergyStruct}). A value of $D_0$ in the 1 meV range can be expected for a CdTe layer strained on a ZnTe substrate, as shown in Sec.~\ref{CrSemiCon}.

	\label{CrLinPolar}
	\end{figure}
	
	When an electron-hole pair is injected in a Cr-doped QD, the bright excitons are split by the exchange interaction between the spins of Cr and carriers. In flat self-assembled QDs, the heavy-holes and light-holes are separated in energy by the biaxial strain and the confinement. In a first approximation, the ground state in such QD is a pure heavy-hole ($J_z$=$\pm$3/2) exciton and the exchange interaction with the Cr spin S is described by the spin Hamiltonian 
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{c-Cr}=I_{eCr}\mathbf{S}\cdot\bm{\upsigma}+I_{hCr}S_zJ_z
	\end{align}		
with $\bm{\upsigma}$ the electron spin and $J_z$ the hole spin operator. $I_{eCr}$ and $I_{hCr}$ are, respectively, the exchange integrals of the electron and the hole spins with the Cr spin. These exchange energies depend on the exchange constant of the Cr $3d$ electrons with the CdTe carriers and on the overlap of the Cr atom with the confined carriers. Even though the exchange interaction of the Cr spin with both electron and hole is ferromagnetic in most II-VI semiconductor~\cite{MacCdCrSD0beta,KacmanD0alphabetaIIVI,MacspdexchCr}, the hole-Cr interaction is supposed to be anti-ferromagnetic here. It does not change the PL at B = 0T. The only visible effect is on the intensity distribution in the magneto-optics experiments. This will thus be further discussed in Sec.~\ref{MagOptCr}. A typical exchange constant 4 to 5 times larger for the holes than for the electrons is also expected in CdTe~\cite{DMSCrExchInt,CdCrSExchInt}.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=12cm]{04-CrMagOpt/Pictures/Decay.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Time resolved PL of QD2 taken on two outside peaks, attributed to $S_z = \pm1$ (noted (1) and (3) in Fig.~\ref{CrLinPolar}(a)), and the lower energy one (noted (4)).}
	\label{CrDecay}
	\end{figure}
	
	For highly strained CdTe/ZnTe QDs with a weak hole confinement, the strain induced energy splitting of the Cr spin $D_0S^2_z$ is much larger than the exchange energy with the confined carriers ($D_0\gg |I_{hCr}|>|I_{eCr}|$). The exchange interaction with the exciton acts as an effective magnetic field which further splits the Cr spins states $S_z=\pm$1 and $S_z=\pm$2. The resulting X-Cr energy levels are presented in Fig.~\ref{CrEnergyStruct}. The exciton recombination does not affect the Cr atom and its spin is conserved during the optical transitions. Consequently, the large strain induced splitting of the Cr spin is not directly observed in the optical spectra. However, at low temperature, the Cr spin thermalize on the low energy states $S_z$=0 and $S_z$=$\pm$1. This leads to a PL dominated by three contributions: a central line corresponding to $S_z=0$ and the two outer lines associated with $S_z=\pm$1 split by the exchange interaction with the carriers.
	
	Cr-doped quantum dots exhibit a linear polarization dependence, as presented in Fig.~\ref{CrLinPolar}. The central line ($S_z$=0) is split and linearly polarized along two orthogonal directions. As in non-magnetic QDs, this results from a coupling of the two bright excitons $|\pm1\rangle$ by (i) the long-range e-h exchange interaction in a QD with an in-plane shape anisotropy~\cite{SplitInvTh} and/or (ii) the short range e-h exchange interaction in the presence of valence band mixing. This anisotropic e-h exchange energy mixes the bright exciton associated with the same Cr spin state, inducing an extra splitting between them. The mixing is maximum for the central pair of bright excitons (S$_z$=0) which are initially degenerated. The outer lines are also slightly linearly polarized but the influence of the e-h exchange interaction is attenuated by the initial splitting of the $|\pm1\rangle$ excitons induced by the exchange interaction with the Cr spin$S_z=\pm1$.	

	In order to identify the lower energy peak ((4) in Fig.~\ref{CrLinPolar}(a)), we took the time resolved photoluminescence of the emission peaks, presented in Fig.~\ref{CrDecay}. One can notice that the line (4) present a decay time about twice as long as the high energy peak. Such a long decay would be coherent with the radiative recombination of a dark exciton state. Under normal circumstances, the recombination of such a state is non-radiative. However, it is possible to observe a dark exciton recombination emitting a photon in low symmetry quantum dot~\cite{DELum}. Since it is initially a forbidden transition, the recombination will be less efficient and will thus take more time~\cite{DELongLifetime}. This hypothesis will be confirmed by the magneto-optical study of the dot presented in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptExp} and \ref{CrMagOptMod}.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=14.9cm]{04-CrMagOpt/Pictures/Temp.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Temperature evolution from T=5K to T=40K of (a) QD2 PL and (b) the PL of a QD with a good thermalisation on the low energy states (QD4). Even at 40K, $S_z = \pm2$ states do not appear.}
	\label{CrTemp}
	\end{figure}
	
	Since $S_z = \pm2$ states do not appear on the PL because they cannot be thermally populated, one could expect to see their emission at higher temperature. Fig.~\ref{CrTemp} presents the emission of two dots in function of the temperature. With the increase of the temperature, we observe a significant line broadening induced by the interaction with acoustic phonons. In order to keep a significant PL intensity and resolved PL lines, we limited our investigation to temperature below 50K. Even at this temperature, the $\pm2$ peak does not appear. Still, the figure of the emission change dramatically with the temperature. The intensity of the exterior peaks, associated with the states $\pm1$, fell quickly while the emission of the $S_z = 0$ stays intense until higher temperature. This is an unexpected picture, since the temperature should allow the higher energy states $\pm1$ to be more populated by emptying the ground state. This could be caused by a coupling to dark states, more efficient for $S_z = \pm1$ states than for $S_z = 0$ states, emptying the bright states when they are thermally populated.

		\subsection{Excited states of a Cr-doped QD}	
	
	In order to study the different excited states in a QD doped with a single Cr atom, we took the PLE of QD2 starting close to the energy of the dot's emission. Fig.~\ref{FullPLE}(a) presents the entire PLE of QD2 X-Cr complex. One can note several excited states along the scan.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=13.8cm]{04-CrMagOpt/Pictures/FullPLEv2.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{(a) QD2 X-Cr PLE map in $\pi_{cross}$ polarization. Several excited states are highlighted. (b) Photoluminescence of QD2 X-Cr complex for an excitation at 2120 meV). (c) PLE scan detected on the lower energy peak, taken close to the QD emission energy, showing the phonon replica taken in $\pi$ detection. The emission integrated intensity in function of the laser energy is plotted in (d) (black curve) along with the PL spectra of QD2 taken in $\sigma_{co}$ polarization. (e) PLE map between 2046 meV and 2013 meV presenting several excited, detecting in $\pi_{cross}$ polarization. (f) Zoom in a particular excited state presented a splitting inversion, taken in $\pi_{cross}$ detection.}
	\label{FullPLE}
	\end{figure}
	
	The first remarkable feature of this scan is the luminescence over a large energy range, for an excitation between the dot emission energy and 2004 meV, zoomed in Fig.~\ref{FullPLE} (c). This corresponds to an excitation of the QD via the acoustic phonon band. 
One can notice two sharp intensity diminutions in this emission. Mapping the intensity of the phonon replica to the quantum dot spectrum (Fig.~\ref{FullPLE}(d)), it shows that these diminutions happens when the laser is in resonance with a QD emission line. The absorption then preferentially occurs in this resonantly excited state than in the acoustic phonon band.

	
	Another excited state appear around 2018.5 meV, zoomed in on Fig.~\ref{FullPLE}(f). The first feature of this peak is that, even though the studied dot contain a Cr, each of the peak here presents a slightly different resonant energy. Moreover, one can note that the order of appearance of the two central peaks seems to be reversed compared to the external ones. This phenomenon, called splitting inversion, was first observed on QDs in GaAs quantum well~\cite{FineStructSplitGaAsdots}. It has been discussed by Takagahara~\cite{SplitInvTh} and is likely due to the electron-hole exchange interaction.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=14.9cm]{04-CrMagOpt/Pictures/PLEDotPres.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{(a) PL spectra of the exciton in QD2 (X-Cr) for co-circularly (blue) and cross-circularly (red) polarized excitation/detection taken on the 2120 meV quasi-resonant state.

	\label{PLEDotPres}
	\end{figure}
	
	Another excited state can be sawn at 2025 meV. It can be linked to an excitation through optical phonon. Looking at the $\sigma$ polarized emissions of this state (Fig.~\ref{PLEDotPres}(b) and (c)), we can see that the low and high energy peaks are strongly $\sigma_{co}$ polarized. It means the exciton recombining is of the same spin as the one injected by the laser, and thus shows a good spin conservation of the exciton in the QD during its lifetime. This stabilization of the exciton spin might be due to the Cr spin acting as an effective magnetic field on it. The split central peak emission is linearly polarized, as discussed in Sec.~\ref{CrPres}, and thus its emission shows no dependency in linear polarization. 
	
	Finally, another interesting excited state appear at 2030 meV. This state presents an exchange-induced splitting  different from the splitting in the quasi-resonant state, due to a difference in the carriers and Cr atom wavefunction overlap.

		\subsection{Magneto-optics of a quantum dot doped with a single Cr\label{MagOptCr}}
		
	The structure of the energy levels in Cr-doped QDs is confirmed by the evolution of the PL spectra in magnetic field (up to 11T) along the growth axis, the so called Faraday configuration~\cite{BesombesPumpMnSFD}, presented in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptExp}. Under magnetic field, the bright exciton $X_z = \pm1$ split, leading to a $\sigma-$ branch going at low energy and a $\sigma+$ one going at high energy. This splitting of the excitonunder magnetic field can compensate the one induced by the exchange interaction with the Cr~\cite{LegerQDGeomEffect}. For QD1, this results in an anti-crossing of $|+1\rangle$ and $|-1\rangle$ excitons due to the e-h exchange interaction around B$_z$=6 T observed both in $\sigma+$ and $\sigma-$ polarizations (anti-crossing (2) and (3) in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptExp}(a)).
		
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{04-CrMagOpt/Pictures/MagOptv2.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{(a) Circularly polarized X-Cr PL evolution under magnetic field ($B_z$) in QD1. Anti-crossings  are highlighted and numbered. (b) QD1 X-Cr PL spectra taken at 0 and $10$T for both circular polarization.}
	\label{CrMagOptExp}
	\end{figure}
		
		The low energy emission presented as a dark exciton in Fig.~\ref{CrDecay} shows an anti-crossing with the bright excitons under $B_z$ in $\sigma-$ polarization (anti-crossing (4) in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptExp}). This anti-crossing arises from a mixing of the bright and dark excitons interacting with the same Cr spin state. Observed in $\sigma-$ polarization, it corresponds to the mixing of the exciton states $|-1\rangle$ and $|+2\rangle$ coupled to the Cr spin $S_z=+1$. This dark/bright excitons coupling $\delta_{12}$ is induced by the e-h exchange interaction in a confining potential of reduced symmetry (lower than C$_{2v}$)~\cite{DERecombTh}. In such symmetry, the dark exciton acquire an in-plane dipole moment which leads to possible optical recombination at zero magnetic field~\cite{DELum} as observed in these QDs. The oscillator strength of this "dark exciton" increases as the initial splitting between $|-1\rangle$ and $|+2\rangle$ excitons is reduced by the magnetic field.

	\caption{Linear polarization intensity map (top panel) and intensity map of the longitudinal magnetic field dependence of the emission (bottom panel) of (a) X$^2$-Cr and (b) X-Cr in QD3.}
	\label{CrMagOptLowSym}
	\end{figure}
		
		To illustrate the influence of the QD symmetry on the magneto-optical properties of X-Cr, we show in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptLowSym}(b) the emission of a QD with a different strain or shape anisotropy (QD3). For QD1, the splitting of the central peak is not clear in the PL at 0T (Fig.~\ref{SpectraX}(a)), while two linearly polarized peaks appears clearly in QD3 spectra (Fig.~\ref{SpectraX}(c)).
		
		Investigating both the biexciton and the exciton in the same Cr-doped QD, we can also analyze the impact of the carrier-Cr interaction on the fine structure of the Cr spin. The magnetic field dependency of X$^2$-Cr emission in QD3 is presented along with the X-Cr emission as a contour plot in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptLowSym}(a) and (b) respectively. The PL under magnetic field of X-Cr and X$^2$-Cr presents a mirror symmetry. In particular, the dark/bright exciton mixing observed around $B_z=2.5$ T on the low energy side of the PL in $\sigma-$ polarization for X-Cr is observed on the high energy side in $\sigma+$ polarization for X$^2$-Cr (circles in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptLowSym}(a) and (b)).

	\label{CrAntiferro}
	\end{figure}
		
		If one consider the ground state of X$^2$ as a spin-singlet (total spin 0), it cannot be split by the magnetic field or the spin interaction part of the carriers-Cr hamiltonian. The creation of two excitons in the QD cancels the exchange interaction with the Cr atom. Thus, the PL of  X$^2$-Cr is controlled by the final state of the optical transitions, i.e. the eigenstates of X-Cr, resulting in the observed mirror symmetry in the PL spectra.

	\label{MnAntiferro}
	\end{figure}
		
	The evolution under magnetic field of the relative intensity of each of the QD peak gives information on the sign of the interaction between the Cr and the hole spin. As shown in Fig.~\ref{CrEnergyStruct}, given a polarization, each peak can be linked to a Cr spin state. As discussed earlier, applying a magnetic field lifts the degeneracy between the exciton states and allows to efficiently select the polarization of the emission. The evolution of the peaks relative intensities under magnetic thus gives information on the hole-Cr exchange interaction sign.
	
	QD4, presented in Fig.~\ref{CrAntiferro}, presents a clear evolution of the intensity under magnetic field and will be used for this study. The central peak intensity stays the stronger of the three peaks, whatever the direction of the magnetic field. This is expected, since the $S_z = 0$ state is not affected by the Zeeman effect. It remains the lower spin state for the Cr atom, and therefore concentrate most of the population. In the $\sigma-$ branch, the high energy peak get brighter while the low energy one disappear for $B_z \geq 8$T in QD4. The situation is opposite in the $\sigma+$ branch, where the intensity concentrate on the lower energy peak.
	
	This evolution is similar as the one observed in II-VI QDs doped by a single Mn atom, presented in Fig.~\ref{MnAntiferro}. It was shown in Yoan L\'eger PhD thesis~\cite{YoanTh} that the $S_z = -\frac{5}{2}$ state of the Mn atom was stabilized under magnetic field. From the evolution of the peaks relative intensity and the polarization of the different Mn states, it was then possible to deduce that the interaction between Mn and hole was anti-ferromagnetic.
	
	The evolution of the peaks relative intensity for the Cr looks like the one for the Mn. Under magnetic field, the $S_z = -1$ is stabilized, becoming the lower energy state of the doublet $S_z = \pm1$. For a high enough magnetic field, we can only consider the recombination toward $S_z = -1$. The high energy peak corresponds then to the $|S_z = -1, X_z = -1\rangle \rightarrow |S_z = -1\rangle$ on, emitting a $\sigma-$ polarized photon. The low energy one is associate with the $|S_z = -1, X_z = +1\rangle \rightarrow |S_z = -1\rangle$ transition, emitting a $\sigma+$ polarized photon. This is coherent with an anti-ferromagnetic coupling between the Cr and hole, contradicting the assumption made in Sec.~\ref{CrCdTe} and confirming the energy structure presented in Fig.~\ref{CrEnergyStruct}.
		
	\section{Modelization of a Cr-doped QD\label{QDParam}}
	
	We calculated the magneto-optic behaviour of Cr-doped QDs by diagonalizing the complete Hamiltonian of the e-h-Cr in self-assembled dots. We use for this purpose a spin effective hamiltonian that can be separated as follows:
	
	\begin{align}
\label{X-Cr} {\cal H}_{X-Cr}={\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon}+{\cal H}_{cCr}+{\cal H}_{mag}+{\cal H}_{eh}+{\cal H}_{band}+{\cal H}_{scat}
	\end{align}
where:

${\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon}$ describes the fine structure of the Cr atom and its dependency on local strain, as presented in Eq.~\ref{Cralone}. It is mainly drived by $D_0$, the magnetic anisotropy. E, the in-plane strain anisotropy, also appears in this Hamiltonian, but have to be kept small in order to model the found dots (see Fig.~\ref{CrHighE} for the emission of a dot with a higher E).

\begin{figure}[h!]

	\caption{(a) Top: Calculated linear polarization PL intensity map of X-Cr at zero field. The 0$^{\circ}$ polarization angle correspond to an emission polarized along the $[100]$ axis. Bottom: Calculated X-Cr circularly polarized magnetic field dependency. Details of the model and parameters are listed in Tab.~\ref{CrModelParam}. Corresponding anti-crossing are highlighted in same fashion as on Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptExp} and \ref{CrAntiferro}. On the left, spectra calculated for $B_z = 0$ T and $B_z = 11$ T in both circular polarization are shown. (b) Schema of the magnetic field dependency of the energy levels of the low energy Cr spin states $S_z$=0 and $S_z$=$\pm$1, and corresponding bright ($+1$ blue, $-1$ red) and dark ($|\pm2\rangle$ green) X-Cr energy levels.}
	\label{CrMagOptMod}
	\end{figure}

${\cal H}_{cCr}$ describes the coupling of the electron and hole with the Cr spin, depending on $I_{eCr}$, the exchange integral of the electron-Cr spins, and $I_{hCr}$, the exchange integral of the hole-Cr spins, as described in Eq.~\ref{HCrDMS}.

${\cal H}_{mag}$ describes the effect of an exterior magnetic field, coupled to both the Cr and carrier spins by the Zeeman terms, depending on the $g$-factor of each of them and the Bohr magneton $\mu_B$, and including the diamagnetic shift of the electron-hole via the term $\gamma$.
\begin{align}
	{\cal H}_{mag} = g_{Cr}\mu_B\overrightarrow{B}.\overrightarrow{S}+g_{e}\mu_B\overrightarrow{B}.\overrightarrow{\sigma}+g_{h}\mu_B\overrightarrow{B}.\overrightarrow{J}+\gamma B^2
\end{align}

${\cal H}_{eh}$ describes the short range and long range electron-hole interaction, through the bright and dark exciton splitting $\delta_0$, the bright exciton coupling $\delta_1$, the dark exciton coupling $\delta_2$ and the bright and dark exciton coupling $\delta_{11}$ and $\delta_{12}$. All of these term are described in Eq~\ref{HehCs}.

${\cal H}_{band}$ is the band Hamiltonian. It is written ${\cal H}_{band} = E_g + {\cal H}_{VBM}$, with $E_g$ the CdTe gap energy and ${\cal H}_{VBM}$ is described in Eq.~\ref{HVBM}.

${\cal H}_{scat}$ describes the perturbation of the wave function of the exciton in the initial state of the optical transition by the hole-Cr exchange interaction, controlled by the parameter $\eta$. It was found to be essential to explain the dynamic of X$^+$-Mn and is introduced here for generality purpose. This perturbation depends on the value of the exchange energy between the Cr spin $S_z$  and the hole spin $J_z$ and can be represented, using second order perturbation theory, by an effective spin Hamiltonian \cite{CarInSpinSplit,BiexFinStruct,DynhMn}
\begin{align}
{\cal H}_{scat}=-\eta S_z^2
\end{align}
\noindent with $\eta>0$.

	We considered the general case of QDs with a symmetry lower than C$_{2v}$ (truncated ellipsoidal lens for instance~\cite{DERecombTh}), and took into account the influence of this reduced symmetry on the valence band and on the e-h exchange interaction. The population of the X-Cr spin states split by the large magnetic anisotropy and the carriers-Cr exchange interaction is described by a spin effective temperature $T_{eff}$, applied on the X-Cr levels and the initial state of the hamiltonian. The results of the model obtained with $T_{eff}=$20K, $D_0=2.2$ meV and an electron-Cr (hole-Cr) exchange interaction $I_{eCr}=-50$ $\mu$eV ($I_{hCr}=250$ $\mu$eV) are reported in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptMod} (parameters not specific to Cr-doped QDs are listed in Tab.~\ref{CrModelParam}). Such parameters do not aim to fit the data and are only reasonable order of magnitude to qualitatively reproduce the experimental results of the PL of X-Cr at zero field and its evolution in magnetic field. The splitting of the central line at zero field (anti-crossing (1)) and the anti-crossings under magnetic field (anti-crossings (2) and (3) around $B_z$=6T for the Cr spin states  $S_z = |+1\rangle$ and anti-crossings (4) with the dark exciton around $B_z$=2T) are well reproduced by the model.
	
	This model also predicts an anti-crossing around $B_z = 5$ T, noted (5), caused by an electron-Cr flip flop, which is not sawn on the experiments. Its position is controlled by $D_0$ and its intensity by $I_{eCr}$. However, for this anti-crossing to appear for $B_z > 11$T, a $D_0 > 3$ meV is needed, causing the $S_z = \pm1$ levels to be at high energy and thus giving a stronger emission intensity to the $S_z = 0$ state than the one sawn experimentally. Therefore, a low value of $I_{eCr}$ was chosen instead. Finally, the remaining tail of an anti-crossing, labelled (6), also appears at high magnetic field in the $\sigma-$ polarization, as saw in Fig.~\ref{CrAntiferro}, due to the coupling a bright and a dark exciton coupled to the Cr state $S_z = 0$.

	The magnetic anisotropy $D_0$ cannot be precisely extracted from the PL spectra. However, for $D_0 <  2$ meV, an anti-crossing due to a VBM induced hole-Cr flip-flop between the $|-1, +2\rangle$ and the $|0, -1\rangle$ would appear below B$_z$=11T on the central line in $\sigma-$ polarization. Moreover, as discussed earlier, a $D_0 > 3$ meV would produce a lower PL intensity for the states $S_z = \pm1$. These consideration sets a $D_0$ in the range of 2 to 3 meV. However, even in this range, the intensity distribution of the PL cannot be perfectly reproduced: while the intensity ratio of the peaks is quite well predicted for high value of the magnetic field, the $S_z = 0$ state still present a stronger emission at $B_z = 0$T than the one observed in the experiments. This difference in intensity may be due to out of equilibrium phonons in the sample that help populating the $S_z = \pm1$ states.

	Our model reproduce qualitatively with enough satisfaction the data found experimentally and thus can be used to see the evolution of the emission varying different parameters. Especially, an interesting point is the influence of the anisotropy of strains on the emission. The results of the calculations are presented on Fig.~\ref{CrHighE}.

	\caption{Calculated X-Cr linear polarization intensity map at B = 0T (top) and circularly polarized magnetic dependency (bottom) for dot with an anisotropy of strains (a) $E = 25$ $\mu$eV and (b) $E = 100$ $\mu$eV.}
	\label{CrHighE}
	\end{figure}
	
	The linear polarization dependency of the PL shows a splitting of all the three peaks at 0T, strengthening for a higher anisotropy of strain. 
As discussed previously, the in-plane anisotropy couples two states close in energy and separated by two units of spin. This is the case of the states $S_z = +1$ and $S_z = -1$ for the Cr atom. A small anisotropy of strain cannot couple those states, and thus they do not present linear polarization in QD with a low in-place anisotropy. Increasing the value of the anisotropy make it possible for these levels to be coupled, giving their emission a linear polarization dependency.

	The anisotropy of strain also affects the anti-crossing appearing of the magnetic field dependency. The anti-crossings (1) through (6) remain but we decided not to highlight them for the sake of clarity. Four new anti-crossings appear when increasing the value of $E$. Anti-crossings (9) and (10), on the outside peaks at B = 0T, are caused by the strain anisotropy and are discussed in the previous paragraph. Anti-crossing (7) and (8) appears on the low and high energy peaks at roughly the same magnetic field value and direction as anti-crossing (4). They are caused by the coupling of the states $|S_z = +1, X_z = -1\rangle$ and $|S_z = -1, X_z = -1\rangle$, brought together by the Zeeman effect.

	For a higher value of $E$, the anti-crossings are stronger. They occur on a larger range of energy, and  with a wider split for the anti-crossing (8) and (9). This leads to a superposition of the different anti-crossing, giving a complex magnetic dependency and the apparent reduction of the splitting at B = 0T.
	
	Most of the dot we found presented a small anisotropy. The reason might be a selection bias. The splitting at zero magnetic field leads to a spectra with six different peaks. Moreover, we saw on Fig.~\ref{CrHighE} (b) that the splitting at B = 0T can be reduced due to the width of the anti-crossings. The resolution of our monochromator might then not be precise enough to resolve the peaks, and only shows a broad emission. Such a dot would then not be selected for further studies, leading to a selection bias toward low anisotropy dots.
	
	\section{Charge fluctuation of a Cr ion  in the vicinity  of the QDs\label{ChargeFluc}}
	
	Some dots were found presenting a linear polarization dependency all their peaks, for both X-Cr and X$^2$-Cr. One of them, QD5, is presented on Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksMagOpt}. Such a dependency is expected in dots with a strong in-plane anisotropy, as shown in Sec.~\ref{QDParam}. While a thin and well resolve X$^+$-Cr is observed on all these dots, X-Cr is often not resolved, appearing as a broad emission. Such a result was also expected for dots with strong in-plan anisotropy.

	\label{CrSixPeaksMagOpt}
	\end{figure}
	
	However, studying the dot under magnetic field show no appearance of the expected anti-crossing for a QD with a high in-plane anisotropy. The dots present a single anti-crossing on all their peaks for B = 9T in $\sigma-$ polarization. It is due to the mixing between bright and dark exciton. Such an evolution under magnetic tend to characterise three non-magnetic QDs emitting at close energy. However, all the peaks were found to have the maximum intensity for the same position on the sample, and they share excited states on the PLE. It is highly improbable to find three dots close to each other, emitting almost at the same energy and sharing excited states at several position on the sample.

	\label{CrSixPeaksEFieldX+}
	\end{figure}	
	
	To further investigate those dots, we study the evolution of their emission under bias voltage. The application of an electric field was realized via a sample with a Schottky gate in the same fashion than the one in Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksEFieldX+}(c). The resulting map is presented in Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksEFieldX+}(a). The first visible feature is the strong electric field dependency of the emission energy, more marked for X-Cr than for the X$^c$-Cr systems. The emission energy variation of the X-Cr complex occurs in a 2.9 meV range.
	
	There is another remarkable point on these maps, evidenced on the X$^+$-Cr complex on the Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksEFieldX+}(b): the splitting between each peak is changing with the applied electric field. The splitting between the high and low energy peaks varies from 0 meV for an applied bias voltage of -8V (no splitting) to 0.7 meV for 8V applied. This disappearance of the splitting for a certain bias voltage indicates that phenomena inducing an emission at three different energy can be tuned using an external electric field.

	\label{CrSixPeaksSplit}
	\end{figure}
		
	Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksSplit} shows that, using electric field, we can manipulate the splitting of any given charged state of the QD. For all positive bias voltage between 0V and 7V, X-Cr present a broad emission containing all six peaks in linear emission, as show on Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksSplit}(a). The emission then divide into three distinct peaks, starting to appear around -1V. This is evidenced on the the PL emission on Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksSplit}(d).

	\label{CrOutsideDot}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	We propose that those dots particular PLs are caused by Cr in the ZnTe barrier close to the dot. Cr is incorporated in ZnTe as Cr$^{2+}$, but, as shown on Fig.\ref{CrOutsideDot}(a), the Cr$^+$ and Cr$^{3+}$ states are in the gap and accessible~\cite{CrZnTe}, either by capturing an electron (Cr$^+$) or a hole (Cr$^{3+}$). Considering such a charge close to the QD, it can be viewed as a punctual one, since the dot is far bigger than the atom. The effect on the wave functions, presented in Fig.\ref{CrOutsideDot}(b)-(d), differs depending on the electrical charge of the Cr atom. Cr$^{2+}$ is the neutral state of Cr in ZnTe, sharing its outer shell electrons to bond with the atoms of the crystal. It is therefore the neutral position of the QD-Cr system. Capturing an electron, the Cr atom get a supplementary negative charge, and will thus attract more strongly the hole confined in the QD and repel the electron. The opposite happens when the Cr capture a hole.
	
	The electron is well confined in CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots and is thus not affected strongly by the presence of a punctual charge close to the QD. The hole, on the other hand, is only weakly confined in CdTe/ZnTe QDs. Its wavefunction is then more strongly affected by the charge variations of the Chromium. 
Because of this weak confinement, the hole wavefunction goes slightly out of the dot, and thus may overlap with the Cr atom. Its shape will then be strongly affected by change of charge of the Cr atom atom, being repel when the magnetic atom capture a hole, attracted when it capture an electron. This change in shape of the hole wavefunction affect the exchange interaction with the electron, and thus the emission energy of the exciton. The application of an electric field through the Schottky gate attract the hole toward the surface or the back of the sample, depending on the direction of the applied field. This attraction change the overlap of the hole wavefunction with the Cr atom, reducing it to zero for strong enough electric field. The emission energy is then not affected anymore by the charge variation of the Cr.

	
	
	This hypothesis is currently tested, along with the capacity for the Cr to diffuse outside the quantum dots layer.
	
	\section*{Conclusion}
	
	
	For the first time, a single Cr atom was embedded inside a II-VI quantum dot. Such a system presents a characteristic three peaks structure under optical probing. The splitting caused by the magnetic anisotropy is strong enough to keep the states $S_z = \pm2$ to be thermally populated. The central peaks may be split in low symmetry quantum dot, and a fourth peak, corresponding to a dark state may appear on the low energy side. Magneto-optic experiments confirm this energy structure and show several anti-crossing characteristic from a Cr doped quantum dots, giving us possibility to extract parameters of the dot. They also evidence that the h-Cr coupling is anti-ferromagnetic, contrary to what was suggested in the literature. 
	
	Having successfully inserted a probed single Cr atom in CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots, it is now important to study how this system evolve in time. An important step for further use of the system will be the possibility to prepare the Cr spin in a chosen state, and then control it. This is what we propose to study in the next chapter.
