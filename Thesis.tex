	\section{II-VI semiconductor quantum dots}
	
		\subsection{Band structure of CdTe/ZnTe\label{BandStruct}}
		
		ZnTe and CdTe are two II-VI semiconductor, meaning they are composed of an anion from the column VI of periodic table (Te), and a cation from the column II (Cd and Zn). They both crystallize as zinc blend when grown in Molecular Beam Epitaxy. As shown in Fig.~\ref{Zinc-Blende&Brillouin}, in this structure, each species is organized in a face centred lattice, one them being shift from the other by a quarter of the [111] diagonal. Each ion is then in a tetragonal environment, meaning the zinc-blende structure is of the $T_d$ space-group.

	\label{Zinc-Blende&Brillouin}
	\end{figure}

	The external orbital of the cation are $s$ for the cation (4$d^{10}$5$s^2$ for Cd,  3$d^{10}$4$s^2$ for Zn) and $p$ for the anion (4$d^{10}$5$s^2$5$p^4$ for Te). Considering a N unit crystal, it then contain 8N valence electron, coming from the $s$ and $p$ levels of the ions. The $s$ and $p$ orbital of these atoms hybridize to form 8 levels, 4 bonding and 4 anti-bonding.
	
	The lowest band of the bonding levels, coming from $s$ orbitals, will be filled by 2N valence electron. 6N will be taken to fill the three higher energy bonding band, formed by the hybridization of $p$ orbitals. Those bonding states form the valence band. At higher energy, the anti-bonding states form the conduction band. Since all the electron available are used to fill the valence band, the conduction band is empty in the ground state. The lower energy band of the conduction band are formed by the anti-symmetric combination of the $s$ orbitals. At higher energy, the anti-symmetric hybridization of $p$ orbitals form three other bands.

	Introducing the spin-orbit interaction, the conduction band, formed by the hybridazation of $s$ orbitals, is of $\Gamma_6$ (spherical) symmetry at the center of the Brillouin zone (for $k \simeq 0$), two-fold degenerated, with an orbital momentum (spin) $\sigma = 1/2$. In a similar fashion, the valence band will be split into to band: a first one of $\Gamma_8$ symmetry, with a spin $J = 3/2$, four-fold degenerated ; and the second one, at lower energy, of $\Gamma_7$ symmetry, with a spin $1/2$, two-fold degenerated. The splitting $\Gamma_7-\Gamma_8$ is of $\Delta_{SO} \simeq 0.9$ eV in II-VI semiconductor.

	\label{BandStruct}
	\end{figure}
	
	The whole CdTe band structure is presented on Fig.~\ref{BandStruct}. One can note that CdTe is a direct gap semiconductor: the highest energy point of the valence band correspond to the lowest energy point of the conduction band, in $\Gamma$. As we move away from this point, the valence band into two branches: one with small curvature, meaning a high effective mass for the carriers on it, is called the heavy-hole (hh) band, while the one presenting the highest curvature and smallest effective mass is called the light-hole (lh) band.
	
	One way to understand this evolution is to apply the $\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{p}$ approximation, as proposed by Kane in 1957~\cite{KaneBandkp}. This model gives an estimation of the electronic band structure starting from the exact solution and energy of the Schrödinger equation at the center of the Brillouin. The hamiltonian to resolve is then :	
	\begin{align}
		\left(\frac{p^2}{2m_0} + U(\mathbf{r})\right)|\psi_{n,\mathbf{k}}\rangle = E_{n,\mathbf{k}} |\psi_{n,\mathbf{k}}\rangle
	\end{align}
with $U(\mathbf{r})$ the potential of the crystal and $|\psi_{n,\mathbf{k}}\rangle$ the Bloch wave, separated between a periodic part $u_{n,\mathbf{k}} (\mathbf{r})$ and plane-wave part $\exp(i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})$ as follow :
	\begin{align}
		|\psi_{n,\mathbf{k}}\rangle = u_{n,\mathbf{k}} (\mathbf{r}) \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})
	\end{align}

	Neglecting the $\Gamma_7$ band at lower energy, we solve this hamiltonian for carrier on the $\Gamma_6$ and $\Gamma_8$ bands~\cite{ClaireTh}. The $z$-axis is defined along the growth direction of the semiconductor and chosen as the quantization axis. We then find the energy:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{l}
		E_c (k_z) = E_c + \dfrac{\hbar^2 k_z^2}{2m_c} \\
		E_{v, \pm\frac{1}{2}} (k_z) = E_v - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k_z^2}{2m_{lh}} \\
		E_{v, \pm\frac{3}{2}} (k_z) = E_v + \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2_z}{2m_{0}}
		\end{array}	
	\end{align}
with $E_c$ ($E_v$) the energy of the conduction band (respectively, the valence band), $m_c$ the effective mass of the carrier on the conduction and $m_{lh}$ the effective mass of the light hole. One can see that the splitting of the valence band separate the carrier with a spin $J_z = \pm \frac{3}{2}$ (hh) from the one with a spin $J_z = \pm \frac{1}{2}$ (lh). However, the neglecting of the bands other than $\Gamma_6$ and $\Gamma_8$ lead to a positive curvature for the hh. To correct this problem, we would have to take into account higher energy conduction band, which will repel the hh band and give it its negative curvature.

	Another solution to have the matrix describing the $\Gamma_8$ band is to use symmetry consideration. Luttinger showed in 1956~\cite{LuttingerHam} that the only Hamiltonian fulfilling the cubic symmetry is:
	\begin{align}
	\label{LuttHamil}
		{\cal H}_L = - \frac{h^2}{2m_0}\left(\gamma_1 k^2 I_4 - 2 \gamma_2 \sum_i k_i^2 \left(J_i^2 - \frac{1}{3} J^2\right) - 2 \gamma_3 (k_x k_y (J_x J_y + J_y J_x) + c.p.) \right)
	\end{align}
with $\gamma_1$, $\gamma_2$ and $\gamma_3$ the Luttinger parameters, $I_4$ the 4 $\times$ 4 identity matrix, $\mathbf{k}$ a vector of the Brillouin zone, $\mathbf{J}$ the orbital momentum operator with $J_x$, $J_y$ and $J_z$ being 4 $\times$ 4 matric satisfying $[J_x, J_y] = iJ_z$ and circular permutation, and $c.p$ standing for "circular permutation". 
	This hamiltonian can be simplified using the parameters:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{l}
			A = \gamma_1 + \frac{5}{2} \gamma_2 \\
			B = 2 \gamma_2 \\
			C = 2(\gamma_3 - \gamma_2)
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
Using these, the Luttinger hamiltonian can be rewritten:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_L = - \frac{h^2}{2m_0}(Ak^2 I_4 - B(\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{J})^2 + C(k_x k_y (J_x J_y + J_y J_x) + c.p.))
	\end{align}
The $B$-term lift the degeneracy of the $\Gamma_8$ band into two sub-bands as shown above, and is invariant under arbitrary rotations. The $C$-term describes the warping of the valence band.

	In the spherical approximation, the Luttinger hamiltonian has two eigenvalues:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{l}
			E_{hh} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0 (A-2.25B)^{-1}} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0 (\gamma_1 - 2 \gamma_2 )^{-1}} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_{hh}} \\
			E_{lh} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0 (A-0.25B)^{-1}} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_0 (\gamma_1 + 2 \gamma_2 )^{-1}} = - \dfrac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m_{lh}}
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
We find back the value of the effective mass for the lh, along with a value for the hh. The hh band also presents here a negative curvature, as expected.

	The parameters and carriers effective masses are given in the Tab.~\ref{Param}.

	The Luttinger hamiltonian is usually written in matrix form. In the ($u_{\Gamma_8, +\frac{3}{2}}$, $u_{\Gamma_8, -\frac{1}{2}}$, $u_{\Gamma_8, +\frac{1}{2}}$, $u_{\Gamma_8, -\frac{3}{2}}$) basis, we can rewrite it:

		\end{pmatrix}

with:

		b &= -2\sqrt{3} \gamma_3 (k_x - ik_y)k_z \\
		c &= - \sqrt{3}(\gamma_2 (k_x^2 - k_y^2) - 2i\gamma_3k_xk_y)
	\end{align*}


		\subsection{Lattice mismatch and the Bir-Pikus Hamiltonian \label{BPSec}}
		
	ZnTe crystal has a lattice parameter of $a_{ZnTe} = $6.10 \AA, while CdTe one is of $a_{CdTe} = $6.48 \AA. This lattice mismatch results in stress in a CdTe layer grown on a ZnTe substrate:
		\begin{align}
			\varepsilon_{\bot} = \frac{a_{ZnTe} - a_{CdTe}}{a_{CdTe}} = -5.8\%
		\end{align}
		
		In order to represent this strain and see their effect on the band, especially the $\Gamma_8$ band, we need to define a hamiltonian representing them. These strains deform the structure, so let's begin the representation with an volume $V = (x\mathbf{u_x} + y\mathbf{u_y} + z\mathbf{u_z}$, with $(\mathbf{u_x}, \mathbf{u_y}, \mathbf{u_z})$ an ortho-normalized basis. This volume will transform into another one $V' = (x\mathbf{u_x'} + y\mathbf{u_y'} + z\mathbf{u_z'})$, where:
		\begin{align}
			\begin{array}{l}							
				\mathbf{u_x'} = (1 + \varepsilon_{xx}')\mathbf{u_x} + \varepsilon_{xy}' \mathbf{u_y} + \varepsilon_{xz}' \mathbf{u_z} \\
				\mathbf{u_y'} = \varepsilon_{yx}' \mathbf{u_x} + (1 + \varepsilon_{yy}')\mathbf{u_y} + \varepsilon_{yz}' \mathbf{u_z} \\
				\mathbf{u_z'} = \varepsilon_{zx}' \mathbf{u_x} + \varepsilon_{zy}' \mathbf{u_y} + (1 + \varepsilon_{zz}')\mathbf{u_z}
			\end{array}
		\end{align}
		
	$\varepsilon_{ij}'$ represents an expansion of the vector $i$ in the direction $j$. They are small deformation of the lattice, so we choose $|\varepsilon_{ij}'| \ll 1$. Such transformations can be decomposed in a symmetric part and an antisymetric one. We note $\overline{\overline{\varepsilon}}$ the symmetric part, called the strain tensor, defined such as:
	\begin{align}
		\varepsilon_{ ii} &= \varepsilon_{ii}' \\
		\varepsilon_{ij} &= \frac{1}{2} \left(\varepsilon_{ij}' + \varepsilon_{ji}'\right)
	\end{align}

	In the linear regime, the strain tensor $\overline{\overline{\varepsilon}}$ is proportional to the stress tensor $\overline{\overline{\sigma}}$, where $\sigma_{ij}$ describe a force parallel to $i$ applied on a surface perpendicular to $j$. Therefore, $\sigma_{ii}$ will describe an elongation or compression stress, while $\sigma_{ij}$ ($i\neq j$) represents a shear stress. Since these tensor are symmetric, we can reduce the number of coefficient from nine to six: $\sigma_{xx}$, $\sigma_{yy}$, $\sigma_{zz}$, $\sigma_{xy} = \sigma_{yx}$, $\sigma_{xz} = \sigma_{zx}$ and $\sigma_{yz} = \sigma_{zy}$. Therefore, in the linear regime and for a cubic crystal, we can write the Hooke's law:
	\begin{align}
	\label{HookeLaw}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\sigma_{xx} \\
			\sigma_{yy} \\
			\sigma_{zz} \\
			\sigma_{xy} \\
			\sigma_{xz} \\
			\sigma_{yz}
		\end{bmatrix}
		=
		\begin{bmatrix}
			C_{11} & C_{12} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
			C_{12} & C_{11} & C_{12} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
			C_{12} & C_{12} & C_{11} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
			0 & 0 & 0 & 2C_{44} & 0 & 0 \\
			0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2C_{44} & 0 \\
			0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 2C_{44}
		\end{bmatrix}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			\varepsilon_{xx} \\
			\varepsilon_{yy} \\
			\varepsilon_{zz} \\
			\varepsilon_{xy} \\
			\varepsilon_{xz} \\
			\varepsilon_{yz}
		\end{bmatrix}
	\end{align}
Since $x$, $y$ and $z$ are physically equivalent, as well as $xy$, $xz$ and $yz$, only two diagonal coefficient are needed, $C_{11}$ and $C_{44}$. These coefficient coupling strains in a direction to a force in the same direction are obviously positives.

	When the considered cube is compressed in one direction (e.g. $\varepsilon_{zz} < 0$), it will expand in the other direction in order to minimize elastic energy ($\varepsilon_{xx}$, $\varepsilon_{yy} > 0$ in the example). If we don't allow strain in these other directions ($\varepsilon_{xx} = \varepsilon_{yy} = 0$), a stress in the x and y directions had to be applied to keep the cube from expanding in these directions ($\sigma_{xx}$, $\sigma_{yy} < 0$ in the example). We can therefore physically expect $C_{12} > 0$.
	
	The strain hamiltonian can be constructed noticing that the strain tensor $\overline{\overline{\varepsilon}}$ induces a shift in the bands energy, and that any $\varepsilon_{ij}$ has the same symmetry as $k_i k_j$. The hamiltonian should then be formarly identical to the Luttinger hamiltonian. In the $\Gamma_8$ subspace, we can then use the Luttinger Hamiltonian, written in Eq.~\ref{LuttHamil}, replacing the $k_i k_j$ by $\varepsilon_{ij}$. We obtain the Bir-Pikus Hamiltonian by replacing the $\gamma_j$ parameters by the Bir-Pikus parameters $a_{\nu}$, $b_{\nu}$ and $d_{\nu}$~\cite{BirPikus}:
	\begin{align}
	\label{BPHamil}
		{\cal H}_{BP} = a_{\nu} \varepsilon I_4 + b_{\nu} \sum_i \varepsilon_{ii} \left(J_i^2 - \frac{1}{3}J^2\right) + \frac{d_{\nu}}{\sqrt{3}}(\varepsilon_{xy} (J_x J_y + J_y J_x) + c.p)
	\end{align}
with $\varepsilon = Tr(\overline{\overline{\varepsilon}}) = \varepsilon_{xx} + \varepsilon_{yy}+ \varepsilon_{zz}$.

	The $a_{\nu}$ term, called the hydrostatic term, is to shift the $\Gamma_8$ energy. The $b_{\nu}$ term represents the shear strain. In case of non-equal $\varepsilon_{ii}$, its effect is to lift up the two $\Gamma_8$ sub-bands as did a $k\neq 0$ in the Luttinger hamiltonian. The $d_{\nu}$ term, the pure shear strain (i.e $\varepsilon_{ij}$ with $i \neq j$), has the same effect on the $\Gamma_8$ band.
	
	One can notice that the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian is completely independant from $\mathbf{k}$, meaning that the band hamiltonian of a strain semiconductor is simply the sum of the sum of the Luttinger hamiltonian ${\cal H}_L$ (Eq.~\ref{LuttHamil}) and the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian ${\cal H}_{BP}$ (Eq.~\ref{BPHamil}).
	
	Let see how this apply to a CdTe layer deposited on a ZnTe layer. We define $z$ as the growth direction. As shown at the begin of this part, CdTe and ZnTe have a lattice mismatch of 5.8\%. Since both crystallize in a cubic lattice, the strain is the same in the $x$ and $y$ direction. We can then write the strain in the $xy$ plane:
	\begin{align}
	\label{epsperp}
		\varepsilon_{xx} = \varepsilon_{yy} = \varepsilon_{\bot} = \frac{a_{ZnTe} - a_{CdTe}}{a_{CdTe}}
	\end{align}
In the $z$ direction, however, no stress apply: the crystal is free to expand in this direction in order to reduce the elastic energy. Therefore, we can write $\sigma_{zz} = 0$ and, according to Hooke's law in Eq.~\ref{HookeLaw}:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			\sigma_{zz} &= C_{12} \varepsilon_{xx} + C_{12} \varepsilon_{yy} + C_{11} \varepsilon_{zz} \\
						&= 0
		\end{array}		
	\end{align}
Using equality \ref{epsperp}, we can then deduce:
	\begin{align}
	\label{epsz}
		\varepsilon_{zz} = - \frac{2C_{12}}{C_{11}} \varepsilon_{\bot} = - \frac{2C_{12}}{C_{11}} \frac{a_{ZnTe} - a_{CdTe}}{a_{CdTe}}
	\end{align}
	
	Since we grow CdTe over a ZnTe substrate, the CdTe lattice is compressed in the plane, i.e. $\varepsilon_{\bot} < 0$. Since $C_{11}$, $C_{12} > 0$ and $\varepsilon_{\bot} < 0$ for CdTe over ZnTe (see Eq.~\ref{epsperp}, one can easily deduce that $\varepsilon_{zz} > 0$. In the hypothesis of no defect created by the lattice mismatch, all the other strain terms are equal to zero. We can then decompose this strain into two component: a hydrostatic part describing the volume variation without breaking the cubic symmetry, and a shear part introducing an anisotropy, breaking this symmetry:
	\begin{align}
		\overline{\overline{\varepsilon_{hyd}}} &= \frac{1}{3}(\varepsilon_{xx} + \varepsilon_{yy} + \varepsilon_{zz})I_3 \\
		\overline{\overline{\varepsilon_{sh}}} &= \overline{\overline{\varepsilon}} - \overline{\overline{\varepsilon_{hyd}}}
	\end{align}
	
	One can notice that $Tr(\overline{\overline{\varepsilon_{hybd}}}) = Tr(\overline{\overline{\varepsilon}}) = \varepsilon$. Since in the case of a hydrostatic compression, such as what is the case with CdTe over ZnTe, $\varepsilon_{hybd} < 0$, we then have $\varepsilon < 0$ and, according to the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian (Eq.~\ref{BPHamil}), the gap of CdTe increase. For CdTe, Bir-Pikus parameter are $a_{\nu} = 0.91$ eV, $b_{\nu} = 0.99$ eV and $d_{\nu} = 2.76$ eV~\cite{CdTeDefPot}.
	
	Seeing that $\varepsilon_{ij} = 0$ for $i\neq j$, we can rewrite the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian without the shear strain term. Moreover, since $J^2 = J_x^2 + J_y^2 + J_z^2$ and that $\varepsilon_{xx} = \varepsilon_{yy} = \varepsilon_{\bot}$, we can simplify this hamiltonian to:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{BP, biax} = a_{\nu} \varepsilon I_4 + \frac{b_{\nu}}{3}(\varepsilon_{\bot} - \varepsilon_{zz})(J_x^2 + J_y^2 - 2 J_z^2)
	\end{align}
And, since we are in the valence band with $J = \frac{3}{2}$ and $J_x^2 + J_y^2 + J_z^2 = J(J+1)I_4$, we can simplify the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian to its final form in the case of biaxal strain:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{BP, biax} = \left(a_{\nu} \varepsilon + \frac{5}{4} b_{\nu} (\varepsilon_{\nu} - \varepsilon_{zz})\right)I_4 - b_{\nu} (\varepsilon_{\nu} - \varepsilon_{zz})J_z^2
	\end{align}
	
	Using Eq.~\ref{epsperp} and \ref{epsz}, we can easily calculate $\varepsilon_{\bot} - \varepsilon_{z}$. Since $J_z|n\rangle = n|n\rangle$, we find:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			E_{\pm \frac{3}{2}} - E_{\pm \frac{1}{2}} &= - 2b_{\nu} \left(1 + \dfrac{2C_{12}}{C_{11}} \right) \dfrac{a_{ZnTe} - a_{CdTe}}{a_{CdTe}} \\
													&= 2b_{\nu} \left(1 + \dfrac{2C_{12}}{C_{11}} \right) \dfrac{a_{CdTe} - a_{ZnTe}}{a_{CdTe}}
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
We find that, in a fully strained CdTe layer over a ZnTe substrate, the hh band is 300 meV above the lh one. In first approximation, we can then neglect the lh contribution in these nanostructures.
		
		\subsection{3D confinement: the quantum dot\label{e-hIntQD}}
		
		Embedding a semiconductor in another one of larger creates trap for carrier, confining them in one or multiple. CdTe conduction band (resp. valence band) is a lower (resp. higher) energy than ZnTe ones, creating such a trap. Using the procedure described in Chap.~\ref{Growth}, we can create nanometre size island of CdTe in a ZnTe lattice, effectively confining electron in all three direction, acting like an 3D well for the free carriers. This confinement lead to a quantization of the carriers energy level and a discretization of the optical properties. This confinement being analogue to the Coulomb interaction of an isolated atom, such a structure is often dubbed "artificial atom". However, the interaction between the hole and the electron cannot be overlook, adding Coulomb interaction between the particule and the quasi-particule. It consists of an attractive term, shifting energy levels, and an exchange interaction (discussed in Chap.~\ref{ExchIntQD}). Moreover, the hole being the absence of an electron, its energy, charge, spin, orbital momentum, $\mathbf{k}$ and mass are, by definition, opposite to the missing electron. The electron-hole system has a hydrogen-like behaviour and is called an exciton.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{FillingPicture.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Dots STM images}
	\label{STM}
	\end{figure}

	Before going to the exchange part, we will see the optical properties of this system. In order to do so, we develop the carrier wave-function on all the Bloch states:
	\begin{align}
		\Psi (\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{n,\mathbf{k}} c_{n,\mathbf{k}} \psi_{n,\mathbf{k}} = \sum_{n,\mathbf{k}} c_{n,\mathbf{k}} u _{n,\mathbf{k}} (\mathbf{r}) \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})
	\end{align}
Since we are in a confined environment, we can only consider the states around $\mathbf{k} = 0$. Since we consider the band extrema, we neglect the inter-band wave function mixing in a first time and use the effective-mass approximation. We can then limit the expansion of Bloch state to an expansion on the $u _{n,0} (\mathbf{r}) \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})$, with $n = \Gamma_6$ for the conduction band and $n = \Gamma_8$ for the valence. We can then write:
	\begin{align}
		\Psi_c (\mathbf{r}) & \simeq \sum_{\mathbf{k}} c_{\mathbf{k}} u _{\Gamma_6,0} (\mathbf{r}) \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r}) = F_e (\mathbf{r}) u _{\Gamma_6,0} \label{eEnvFunc} \\		
		\Psi_v (\mathbf{r}) & \simeq \sum_{J_z = \{\pm \frac{3}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{2}\}, k} c_{J_z,\mathbf{k}} u _{\Gamma_8,J_z} (\mathbf{r}) \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})  = \sum_{J_z = \{\pm \frac{3}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{2}\}} F_{J_z} (\mathbf{r}) u _{\Gamma_8,J_z} \label{hEnvFunc}
	\end{align}
with $F_e (\mathbf{r}) = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} c_{\mathbf{k}} \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})$ the electron envelop function and $F_{J_z} (\mathbf{r}) = c_{J_z,\mathbf{k}} \exp (i\mathbf{k}.\mathbf{r})$, $J_z = \{\pm \frac{3}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{2}\}$ the hole envelop functions.

	The effective mass approximation allow us to replace the periodic crystal potential and the free-electron kinetic energy by the effective Hamiltonian representing the band extrema, using $m_e$ for the conduction band 
and ${\cal H}_L + {\cal H}_{BP}$ for the top of the valence band. Considering the effective mass is the same in CdTe and ZnTe, we can now work with the simple picture of an effective mass carrier with the envelop function defined in Eqs.~\ref{eEnvFunc} and \ref{hEnvFunc}, trapped in a potential $V_e (\mathbf{r})$ for the conduction band or $V_h (\mathbf{r})$ for the valence band, creating by the band offset between the two semiconductors. We write the Schrödinger equations for these particle:
	\begin{align}
		\left(\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}\Delta \right)F_e (\mathbf{r}) + V_e (\mathbf{r}) F_e (\mathbf{r}) &= EF_e (\mathbf{r}) \label{eSchroding} \\
		(\tilde{{\cal H}}_L + \tilde{{\cal H}}_{BP} + V_h (\mathbf{r})) 
			\begin{pmatrix}
				F_{+ \frac{3}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) \\
				F_{+ \frac{1}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) \\
				F_{- \frac{1}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) \\
				F_{- \frac{3}{2}} (\mathbf{r})
			\end{pmatrix}
			&= E
			\begin{pmatrix}
				F_{+ \frac{3}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) \\
				F_{+ \frac{1}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) \\
				F_{- \frac{1}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) \\
				F_{- \frac{3}{2}} (\mathbf{r})
			\end{pmatrix}
			\label{hSchroding}
	\end{align}
with $\tilde{{\cal H}}_L$ and $\tilde{{\cal H}}_{BP}$ the hole hamiltonians, opposite to the electron hamiltonians defined in Eq.~\ref{LuttHamil} and \ref{BPHamil}. In $\tilde{{\cal H}}_L$, the $k$-terms transform into a gradient of the envelop function with the form $i\nabla$. For simplicity, the $\tilde{}$ will be dropped in the next equations. The derivation of the effective mass approximation can be found in reference \cite{LuttElecMotion}.

	In order to analytically solve these hamiltonian, another approximation is necessary. As discussed in section \ref{BandStruct}, ${\cal H}_{L}$ couple the hh and lh through its non-diagonal terms, while ${\cal H}_{BP}$ lift their degeneracy, as shown in Sec.~\ref{BPSec}. Considering the presence of biaxial strain, we can neglect the non-diagonal terms of ${\cal H}_{L}$ in regard to the action of ${\cal H}_{BP}$. This is the heavy hole approximation, un coupling the four differential equations defined in Eq.~\ref{hSchroding}. Only the ground states $|\pm \frac{3}{2}\rangle$ are considered, with the effective mass given by the diagonal term of ${\cal H}_{L}$, noted $m_{h, \parallel}$ in the plane and $m_{h, z}$ along the growth axis.
	
	In the general case, we still cannot solve this problem. However, it is however possible for some chosen potential. Let's consider a lens like quantum dot, with a radius in the $xy$ plane, noted $\rho$, much larger than it height $L_z$. We can therefore define two different harmonic oscillator of potential: a 2D oscillator $V_{c,v} (\rho)$ in the plane, and a 1D oscillator $V_{c,v} (z)$ along the growth axis:
	\begin{align}
		V_{c,v} (\rho) = 4 \Delta E_{c,v} \frac{\rho ^2}{L_z^2} \\
		V_{c,v} (z) = 4 \Delta E_{c,v} \frac{z^2}{L_z^2}
	\end{align}
with $\Delta E_{c,v}$ the difference of conduction (resp. valence) band energy between the semiconductor. The potential of the whole quantum will the be $V_{c,v} (\mathbf{r}) = V_{c,v} (\rho) + V_{c,v} (z)$. Separating the potential in those two parts means we are searching for solution of the form $F(z, \rho, \theta) = \chi (z) \phi_{n,m} (\rho, \theta)$, with $\theta$ the angle between the position vector and the $x$ axis.

	We write the characteristic spatial width and characteristic frequency of the 2D harmonic oscillator felt by the hole:
	\begin{align}
		\Sigma_{\rho}^h &= \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m_{h, \parallel} \omega_{\rho}^{h}}} \\
		\omega_{\rho}^{h} &= \sqrt{\frac{8\Delta E_{v}}{m_{h, \parallel} L_{\rho}^2}}
	\end{align}
We can write the same equality along $z$ replacing $\rho$ by $z$ and $m_{h, \parallel}$ by $m_{h,z}$. The same can be done for electron, replacing the  $m_{h, \parallel}$ or $m_{h,z}$ by $m_e$ and $E_v$ by $E_c$.

	We can find in textbook such as ref.~\cite{MecQBasvant} the solution of a harmonic oscillator from which we can deduce the solution for the ground state (GS) and the first two degenerated excited states. The first excited state is found to have an angular momentum $l_z = \pm 1$, and is then noted $Exc, \pm 1$. The envelop functions and energy are then found to be:
	\begin{align}
			& F_{c,v}^{GS} (z, \rho, \theta) = \frac{1}{(\sqrt{\pi}\Sigma_z)^{\frac{1}{2}}} \exp \left(- \frac{z^2}{2 \Sigma_z^2}\right) \frac{1}{(\sqrt{\pi}\Sigma_{\rho})^{\frac{1}{2}}} \exp \left(- \frac{\rho^2}{2 \Sigma_{\rho}^2}\right) \label{GSWF} \\
			& E_{e,h}^{GS} = \hbar \frac{\omega_z^{e,h} + \omega_{\rho}^{e,h}}{2} \\
		\nonumber \\
			& F_{c,v}^{Exc, \pm 1} (z, \rho, \theta) = \frac{1}{(\sqrt{\pi}\Sigma_z)^{\frac{1}{2}}} \exp \left(- \frac{z^2}{2 \Sigma_z^2}\right) \frac{1}{(\sqrt{\pi}\Sigma_{\rho})^{\frac{1}{2}}} \exp \left(- \frac{\rho^2}{2 \Sigma_{\rho}^2}\right) \frac{\rho}{\sigma_{\rho}} \exp (\pm i\theta) \label{ExcWF} \\
			& E_{e,h}^{Exc, \pm 1} = \hbar \frac{\omega_z^{e,h} + 3 \omega_{\rho}^{e,h}}{2}
	\end{align}
We see that this energy level are quantified in a way looking like an isolated atom, as pointed earlier. In reference to the atomic notation, the ground state, lower energy level, is noted $S$ and the two first degenerated level are noted $P$, even though atomic p-states usually are 3 fold degenerated.

	One remarkable feature of the envelop functions is that both GS and the two first excited states present the same envelop along the $z$ axis. The cause is directly the symmetry of the QD: since $L_z \ll L_{\rho}$, $\omega_z^{e,h} \gg \omega_{\rho}^{e,h}$, and since $E_{osc.\ harmo.} = (n+\frac{1}{2})\hbar \omega$, the next possible envelop function along the $z$ axis is at higher energy than the next one in the plane. This geometry is also responsible for the 2 fold degeneracy of the $P$-states.
	
	Both the GS and the excited states are once again degenerated due to the spin of the electron and the hole. The electron is in the conduction band with the $\Gamma_6$ symmetry: it can then take the value $\sigma_z = \pm \frac{1}{2}$ (noted $|\uparrow\rangle$ for $+\frac{1}{2}$ and $|\downarrow\rangle$ for $-\frac{1}{2}$). Since we are in the hh approximation, considering the lh are high enough energy to be negligible, the hole spin can only take the values $J_z = \pm \frac{3}{2}$ (noted $|\Uparrow\rangle$ for $+\frac{3}{2}$ and $|\Downarrow\rangle$ for $-\frac{3}{2}$). As pointed ahead, the hole is defined with the opposed characteristic of the missing electron (which may not be the one trapped in the QD). For instance, a hole $|\Downarrow\rangle$ corresponds to the absence of a valence electron $\Psi_v (\mathbf{r}) = u_{\Gamma_8, \frac{3}{2}} (\mathbf{r}) F_{\frac{3}{2}} (\mathbf{r})$.
	
	In order to find the optical properties of the quantum dot, we use the dipole approximation, giving the coupling to light as $H = -\frac{q}{m}\mathbf{p}.\mathbf{A}$, with $\mathbf{p}$ the momentum and $\mathbf{A}$ the vector potential. We can then determine the optical properties looking at the coupling through the $\mathbf{p}$ operator. In a QD, the light-matter interaction occur mainly through two processes: the absorption of a photon creating an exciton, and the recombination of an exciton emitting a photon. To model this, we consider the interband matrix element between the two electronic states $\Psi_c$ and $\Psi_v$, as written in Eqs.~\ref{eEnvFunc} and \ref{hEnvFunc}:
	\begin{align}
		|\langle \Psi_v | \mathbf{p} | \Psi_c \rangle |^2 = |\langle F_v | F_c \rangle |^2|\langle u_{\Gamma_8, J_z} | \mathbf{p} | u_{\Gamma_6, \sigma_z} \rangle |^2
	\end{align}
The first term is just the overlap of the envelop function, making sure the hole and the electron: a transition between a $P$ state of the valence band and a $S$ state in the conduction band is then forbidden.

	The second term, showing the interband matrix elements, depending only on the symmetry of the Bloch functions, will then draw the rule for the recombination. We write the spin states $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$. Since, as shown in Sec.~\ref{BandStruct}, the conduction band is formed by $s$ atomic states, we can now note them:
	\begin{align}
		|u_{\Gamma_6, \uparrow}\rangle = |+\rangle \\
		|u_{\Gamma_6, \downarrow}\rangle = |-\rangle
	\end{align}
The valence, being formed by $p$ atomic states, has to also take the $|X\rangle$, $|Y\rangle$ and $|Z\rangle$ electronic states. We can then write the three eigenstates of the electronic part:
	\begin{align}
		|+1\rangle &= -\frac{|X\rangle + i|Y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}} \\
		|0\rangle &= |Z\rangle \\
		|-1\rangle &= \frac{|X\rangle - i|Y\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}
	\end{align}
We can now write the states of the conduction band by composing these electronic states to the spin states:
	\begin{align}
		|u_{\Gamma_8, +\frac{3}{2}}\rangle &= |+1\rangle|+\rangle \\
		|u_{\Gamma_8, +\frac{1}{2}}\rangle &= \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}|0\rangle|+\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}|+1\rangle|-\rangle \\
		|u_{\Gamma_8, -\frac{1}{2}}\rangle &= \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}|0\rangle|-\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}|-1\rangle|+\rangle \\
		|u_{\Gamma_8, -\frac{3}{2}}\rangle &= |-1\rangle|-\rangle
	\end{align}
Since we are working in the hh approximation, we neglect the contribution of the states $|u_{\Gamma_8, \pm \frac{1}{2}}\rangle$, calculating the interband matrix element only for $|u_{\Gamma_8, \pm \frac{3}{2}}\rangle$. Since $|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$ are orthogonal states, it is then clear that there is only two optically active transitions:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item between $|u_{\Gamma_6, \uparrow}\rangle$ and $|u_{\Gamma_8, +\frac{3}{2}}\rangle$ (hole $|\Downarrow\rangle$), coupled by $p_- = p_x - i p_y$, corresponding to $\sigma_-$ photon absorption or emission.
		\item between $|u_{\Gamma_6, \downarrow}\rangle$ and $|u_{\Gamma_8, -\frac{3}{2}}\rangle$ (hole $|\Uparrow\rangle$), coupled by $p_+ = p_x + i p_y$, corresponding to $\sigma_+$ photon absorption or emission.
	\end{itemize}
	
	We see thus that, for an exciton in the $S$ state of the QD, four configurations are possible. First, we have the bright states $|\uparrow \Downarrow \rangle$, with an angular momentum $X_z = \sigma_z + J_z = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = -1$, and $|\downarrow \Uparrow \rangle$, with an angular momentum $X_z = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{2} = +1$. Both of these states are optically active, meaning their transitions are permitted and they can recombine radiatively. Two other states can exists, called dark states: $\uparrow \Uparrow \rangle$, with an angular momentum $X_z = +2$, and $\downarrow \Downarrow \rangle$, with an angular momentum $X_z = -2$.
	
	Approximating the QD potential as harmonic usually overestimate the confinement, and thus the single-particle energy. But the wave-functions found in this chapter can still be used as trial wave-functions for variational calculations in other potential, in order to estimate the correct energy level.
	
	We discussed in this chapter about the neutral exciton ($X$), formed by a single electron-hole pair. However, several types of exciton can be observed in a quantum dot. First to consider are the charged excitons. In this case, a supplementary charge is injected in the QD in addition to the exciton, forming a hole-hole-electron ($X^+$) or hole-electron-electron ($X^-$) complex. It also happen that two exciton with opposed spins are trapped in a dot. This complex is called biexciton, noted $X^2$, and relax to leave a single neutral exciton in the QD. Charged biexciton and other multi-exciton complex also exist but are not discussed on the thesis. Even if the physics of each of this system is different, the selection rule devised in this chapter apply to all of them.

		\subsection{Valence band mixing\label{VBM}}	
		
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{FillingPicture.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Linear polarization of empty dot}
	\label{XAlLinPol}
	\end{figure}
		
	This single picture, however, don't represent accurately most of the experiment. In a lot of found dots, both $X$ and $X^2$ presents two peaks with linear polarization dependency, as presented in Fig.~\ref{XAlLinPol}. This picture could be explained by the long-range exchange interaction, presented in Sec.~\ref{ExchDMS}. However, it predicts an angle between the two linearly polarized states of $90^\circ$, while the observed angle is far from this value. Moreover, in charged species, the electron (resp. hole) interact with two holes (resp. electrons) with opposite spins, leading to an absence of exchange interaction. Therefore, in the hh approximation, neither $X^+$ nor $X^-$ should present linear polarization dependency. However, such a dependency can be observed in actual dots.
	
	However, we saw in Sec.~\ref{e-hIntQD} that the hh approximation supposed neglecting lh contribution in the Luttinger hamiltonian, through the presence of biaxial strain lifting their degeneracy with hh. However, we can see in the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian (Eq.~\ref{BPHamil}) that introducing an anisotropic distribution of strain ($\varepsilon_{xx} \neq \varepsilon_{yy}$ or $\varepsilon_{ij} \neq 0$ with $i \neq j$) can mix hh states $J_z = \pm \frac{3}{2}$ and lh states $J_z = \mp \frac{1}{2}$. Such a mixing, called Valence Band Mixing (VBM) can also occur through the Luttinger hamltonian in an anisotropic dot ($L_x \neq L_y$), but it would be weaker than the one occurring through Bir-Pikus hamiltonian.
	
	Looking at the matrix form of the Luttinger hamiltonian in Eq.~\ref{HLMat}, we see that $\pm \frac{3}{2}$ could also be coupled to $\pm \frac{1}{2}$ through the $b$ term. However, we supposed that the wave function can be separated into a pure $z$ component and a pure $x - y$ one, meaning $\langle \chi_i (z) | k_z | \chi_j (z) \rangle = 0$ with $\chi_{(i,j)} (z)$ define in Eqs.~\ref{GSWF} and \ref{ExcWF}. This means $b$ doesn't couple envelop functions. A similar coupling parameter appear in the Bir-Pikus hamiltonian due to the shear strains $\varepsilon_{zx}$ and $\varepsilon_{zy}$. However, in most of the found dots, $\varepsilon_{zx}$ and $\varepsilon_{zy}$ is found to be negligible~\cite{YoanTh}.
	
	The envelop function mainly test the overlap and the energy state of the exciton. It doesn't affect light polarization. Therefore, in order to understand the effects of the VBM on the polarization of the dot emission, we can neglect them, only looking at the spin component. We also neglect the envelop function difference between hh and lh. We can then describe the coupling by redefining up and down hole spins as a superposition of $\pm \frac{3}{2}$ and $\mp \frac{1}{2}$. This lh part will be written through a phenomenological parameter $\eta \exp(2i \theta)$ with $\theta$ the direction of the strain:
	\begin{align}
		|\tilde{\Uparrow}\rangle \propto |+\frac{3}{2}\rangle - \eta \exp(2i \theta)|-\frac{1}{2}\rangle \\
		|\tilde{\Downarrow}\rangle \propto |-\frac{3}{2}\rangle - \eta \exp(2i \theta)|+\frac{1}{2}\rangle
	\end{align}
with, in the hypothesis of a small strain-induced VBM:
	\begin{align}
		\eta \exp(2i \theta) = \frac{1}{\Delta_{lh}} (id\varepsilon_{xy} - b(\varepsilon_{xx} - \varepsilon_{yy}))
	\end{align}
with $\Delta_{lh}$ the lh-hh splitting given by the average in-plane bi-axial strain $b(\varepsilon_{xx} = \varepsilon_{yy} + 2\varepsilon_{zz})$. However, experimentally, we can only access $\eta = \frac{E}{\Delta_{lh}}$, with $E$ the anisotropy of strain.

	To see the effect of the VBM on the polarization, we begin to consider the emission of an charged state, where the exchange interaction doesn't affect it. We write the polarization of the detection $\mathbf{e} = \cos (\alpha) \mathbf{e_x} + \sin (\alpha) \mathbf{e_y}$. We then can find the oscillator strength of the transition:
	\begin{align}		
		\begin{array}{rl}
		\label{VBMPolar}
			\Omega (\alpha) &\propto |\langle \uparrow | \cos(\alpha)p_X + \sin(\alpha)o_Y | \uparrow \downarrow \tilde{\Uparrow} \rangle |^2 \\
							&= 1 + \dfrac{\eta^2}{3} + \dfrac{2}{\sqrt{3}} \eta \cos(2(\theta - \alpha))
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
There is then a dependency in linear polarization of the emission, depending on the angle between the polariser and the direction on the strain. In the experiment, no correlation where observed between the polarisation axis of the different quantum dots~\cite{VBMArticle}, as can be expected from the random strain relaxation forming the dots as presented in Chap.~\ref{Growth}.

	We saw that the presence of an anisotropy of strain lead to Valence Band Mixing, characterized a linear polarization dependency of the charged exciton emission. A similar effect is observed on neutral exciton. However, in order to understand the emission of this complex, the exchange also has to be taken into account. It should be noted that dark state are also coupled to each other by $\eta$, acquiring a weak oscillator with a dipole along $z$. More complete has been done by Yoan L\'eger in Ref.~\cite{YoanTh} and \cite{VBMArticle}, taking into account the effective mass carriers envelop functions, and doing calculation beyond the limit of small VBM.

	
	\section{Exchange interaction between carrier and magnetic atom}
	
		\subsection{Exchange interaction in Diluted Magnetic Semiconductors\label{ExchDMS}}
		
		We were interested until now at the structure of a so-called perfect semiconductor, without defect or impurity. However, we are interested in thesis to introduce a low density of either Manganese or Chromium atom in the crystal, namely an impurity. A semiconductor doped in this fashion is called Diluted Magnetic Semiconductor (DMS). This magnetic atom will interact with the semiconductor electrons via its localized electron on its exterior shell. For Mn and Cr, this orbital is the $d$ orbital, so it will be the one considered in the following document. From the interaction between these electron and the one in the conduction band of the semi-conductor, new properties will arise. We can easily write this interaction as an interaction type "Heisenberg". With $|S\rangle$ as the electronic spin of the magnetic impurity and, as previously, $|\sigma\rangle$ as the spin of the conduction electron, we can write:
		\begin{align}
			{\cal H}_{Heisenberg} = I \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{S}
		\end{align}
with $I$ the interaction constant. We write $\bm{\upsigma}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ in the form of Pauli matrix. Namely, for a spin $\frac{1}{2}$ such as $\bm{\upsigma}$, these writes as:
	\begin{align}
		\sigma_x = \frac{\hbar}{2}
					\begin{pmatrix}
						0 & 1 \\
						1 & 0
					\end{pmatrix} ;
		\sigma_y = \frac{\hbar}{2}
					\begin{pmatrix}
						0 & -i \\
						i & 0
					\end{pmatrix} ;
		\sigma_z = \frac{\hbar}{2}
					\begin{pmatrix}
						1 & 0 \\
						0 & -1
					\end{pmatrix}
	\end{align}
	
	This formally simple interaction represent the Pauli exclusion principle through the interaction between two spins. Almost the interaction in this chapter will be of this form, although presenting different physical process, with only the interaction constant $I$ varying from one another.
	
	The inserted impurities didn't modify the crystal structure, meaning the semiconductor wave function will not be significantly altered by them. We can then as usual note the conduction electron wave function as $|\psi_{\mathbf{k}}\rangle|\sigma;\sigma_z\rangle \equiv |\psi_{\mathbf{k}};\sigma_z\rangle$, $|\psi_{\mathbf{k}}$ being the Bloch function of the semiconductor. On the other side, considering a magnetic atom at $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{R_d}$, we write the spatial component of the wave function $\Phi_d (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R_d})$. Its total electronic spin, sum of the electron spins on its $d$ orbital, is noted $|S; S_z\rangle$. The whole wave function of the magnetic atom is then $|\Phi_d;S_Z\rangle$.
	
	Using Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we can write the hamiltonian for these electrons:
	\begin{align}
	\label{BOHamil}
		{\cal H}_{BO} = \sum_i \left(\frac{p_i^2}{2m_c} + V_c (\mathbf{r}_i) \right) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j} \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 |\mathbf{r_i} - \mathbf{r_j}|}
	\end{align}
This first is a single particle hamiltonian, taking into account the kinetic energy of the electron and the crystal potential $V_c (\mathbf{r}_i)$ felt by the electron at the position $\mathbf{r}_i$. This potential include the impurities potential, meaning it will be different at the impurities positions than elsewhere in the semiconductor. The final term represents the Coulomb interaction between the electrons.

	We can rewrite this hamiltonian using second quantification. We define the destruction (resp. creation) operator of a particle in the conduction band at the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ and the spin $\sigma$ as $a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}$ (resp. $a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}^{\dagger}$). In the same fashion, we define the destruction (resp. creation) operator of the electronic level of an impurity as $a_{d, S}$ (resp. $a_{d, S}^{\dagger}$). Supposing the number of electron on the $d$ orbital of the magnetic atoms doesn't change, the hamiltonian \ref{BOHamil} then become:
	\begin{align}
			{\cal H}_{SQ} &= \sum_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma} E_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma} + \sum_{S} E_d a_{d, S}^{\dagger} a_{d, S} + \sum_{\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{k}'} U_{\mathbf{k}, \mathbf{k}'} a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}', \sigma} \nonumber \\
								&\qquad\qquad\quad+ \sum_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma, S} M_{\mathbf{k}} (a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{d, S} + a_{d, S}^{\dagger} a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}) + \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j,k,l} V_{i,j,m,n} a_i^{\dagger} a_j^{\dagger} a_n a_m \label{HamilSQ} \\
						&= {\cal H}_0 + {\cal H}_d + V_d + {\cal H}_{hyb} + {\cal H}_{Coulomb} \nonumber
	\end{align}
The constant electron number supposition is good enough for the picture we want to draw since most of the spin-driven interaction do not induce a change of this number.

	${\cal H}_0$ represents the energy of the unperturbed wave function of the semiconductor, with $E_k$ the energy of an electron with the wave vector $\mathbf{k}$.
	
	${\cal H}_d$ is the same as ${\cal H}_0$ but for an electron of the $d$ orbital of the considered magnetic impurity, with $E_d$ the energy of an electron on this orbital.
	
	$V_d$ represents the impurities potential, allowing the semiconductor electrons to scatter on it. However, Mn and Cr does not modify strongly the crystal potential. We can then consider that the states of the semiconductor $|\psi_k\rangle$ are also solution of the full crystal potential, including impurity, and neglect this term.
	
	${\cal H}_{hyb}$ mix the semiconductor states with the states of the impurities. It represents an exchange interaction between an electron of the semiconductor and one of the $d$ orbital of an impurity. It is also called the Anderson hamiltonian We can write the exchange constant as:
	\begin{align}
		V_{kd} = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \psi_k^* (\mathbf{r}) {\cal H}_1 \Phi_d (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R_d})
	\end{align}
with ${\cal H}_1$ the one particle hamiltonian. This term depend on the Bloch state of both the semiconductor and the impurity, meaning it can be reduce to zero by the symmetry of such functions in some specific cases.

	Let's now focus on last term, ${\cal H}_{Coulomb}$, representing the two particles exchange ${\cal H}_{Coulomb}$. $i$, $j$, $m$ and $n$ each represents a full wave function, both spatial and spin part, and can be either a electron of the semiconductor or of one of the impurities. We can then separate this hamiltonian in three different term depending on the value of $i$, $j$, $m$ and $n$ and illustrated in Fig.~\ref{ExchInterIllust}.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{FillingPicture.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Exchange interaction diagram (I.2 in Laurent thesis)}
	\label{ExchInterIllust}
	\end{figure}

	The first case is when all the states belong to the continuum, appearing as $J_1$ on the diagram. Using Hartree-Fock approximation, considering all electron of the semiconductor except the one we look at as an effective electric field, we can include this term in the crystal potential, representing now both the potential of the ion lattice and the potential of the electrons. $V_{kd}$ will then use ${\cal H}_{HF}$ instead of ${\cal H}_1$:
	\begin{align}
	V_{kd} = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \psi_k^* (\mathbf{r}) {\cal H}_{HF} \Phi_d (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R_d}) \label{Vkd}
	\end{align}
The interaction between the electron of the semiconductor will then be treated with more details in Sec.~\ref{ExchIntQD}.
	
	We then have the case of two electrons from a localized atom. It represents internal transitions of the atom and will be treated separately when needed and represents the Hund rule. It will be noted ${\cal H}_U$.
	
	The final possibility is the interaction between an electron from the magnetic atom and an electron from the semiconductor. It can be separated in two terms that will be developed in the next paragraphs: a direct Coulomb interaction between the two electrons, and an exchange interaction arising from the fermionic nature of electrons.
	
	The direct Coulomb interaction doesn't depends on electrons spins. It only act on the total energy of the system and is therefore only needed when searching the total energy of an exciton. We write it:
	\begin{align}
		K &= + \sum_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma, \sigma'} K_{\mathbf{k}} a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{d, \sigma'}^{\dagger} a_{d, \sigma'} a_{\mathbf{k}, \sigma} \\
		\text{with} \nonumber \\
		K_k &= \int \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}' |\psi_k (\mathbf{r})|^2 \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 |\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}|} |\Phi_d (\mathbf{r}')|^2 \nonumber
	\end{align}
It is clear that the spin $\sigma$ (resp. $\sigma'$) of the $k$ electron (resp. $d$ electron) is not changed by this interaction. Since it only induce a shift in the total energy, we can redefine the energy axis to ignore it.

	In second quantification, we write the exchange interaction:
		\begin{align}
			J &= + \sum_{k, k', \sigma, \sigma'} I_{kk'}^{ex} a_{k', \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{d, \sigma'}^{\dagger} a_{k, \sigma'} a_{d, \sigma} = + \sum_{k, k', \sigma, \sigma'} J_{kk'} a_{k', \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k, \sigma'} a_{d, \sigma'}^{\dagger} a_{d, \sigma} \label{sdSQ} \\
			\text{with} \nonumber \\
			I_{kk'}^{ex} &= \int \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r} \mathrm{d} \mathbf{r}' \psi_{k'}^* (\mathbf{r}) \psi_{k}^* (\mathbf{r}') \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 |\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}|} \Phi_{d}^* (\mathbf{r}) \Phi_{d}^* (\mathbf{r}') \label{sdConst}
		\end{align}
As can be sawn on Eq.~\ref{sdSQ}, this interaction exchange the spin $\sigma$ and $\sigma'$ of both electron, thus its name. However, \ref{sdConst} show that the spin interaction comes from a Coulomb interaction between two fermions.

	We define:
		\begin{align}
			\begin{array}{rl}
				\sigma_{kk'}^z &= a_{k, \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k', \sigma} - a_{k, -\sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k', -\sigma} \\
				\sigma_{kk'}^+ &= a_{k, \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k', -\sigma} \\
				\sigma_{kk'}^- &= a_{k, -\sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k', \sigma}
			\end{array}
		\end{align}
Considering now that this interaction do not change the number of electron on the $d$ orbital of the considered magnetic atom, we can find the Kondo hamiltonian:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{sd} = - \sum_{k, k'} I_{kk'}^{ex} \bm{\upsigma}_{k,k'}.\mathbf{S}
	\end{align}
Since $J_{k,k'}$ is positive, the negative sign in front of the Kondo hamiltonian shows that the energy minimum is reached when the spins of both electron are aligned, and is therefore ferromagnetic.
	
	We can now write the hamiltonian \ref{HamilSQ}, detailing these new hamiltonians:
		\begin{align}
			{\cal H}_{SQ} &= {\cal H}_0 + {\cal H}_d + {\cal H}_{hyb} + {\cal H}_{U} + {\cal H}_{sd}
		\end{align}
with the exchange constant in ${\cal H}_{hyb}$, $V_{kd} = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \psi_k^* (\mathbf{r}) {\cal H}_{HF} \Phi_d (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{R_d})$.

	We now have two hamiltonians to model the exchange interaction between the impurities electrons and the one in the conduction band of the semiconductor: ${\cal H}_{hyb}$ and ${\cal H}_{sd}$. Schrieffer and Wolff rewrote Anderson hamiltonian in order to give a form closer to the Kondo hamiltonian:
	\begin{align}
			{\cal H}_{hyb} &= \sum_{k,k'} V_{kd} V_{k'd} \left(\dfrac{1}{E_k - (E_d + U)} + \dfrac{1}{E_{k'} - (E_d + U)}\right. \nonumber \\
			 				& \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \left. - \dfrac{1}{E_k - E_d} - \dfrac{1}{E_{k'} - E_d}\right)a_{k', \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k, -\sigma} a_{d, S-2\sigma}^{\dagger} a_{d, S} \nonumber \\
			 				&= \sum_{k,k'} I_{kk'}^{hyb} a_{k', \sigma}^{\dagger} a_{k, -\sigma} a_{d, S-2\sigma}^{\dagger} a_{d, S}
	\end{align}
The Fig.~\ref{HybridEner} illustrates the different energies introduced in $I_{kk'}^{hyb}$, presenting virtual transition to the $d$ orbital of the magnetic atom. The two possible energies are $E_d$ for the low energy level, and $E_d + U$ for the high energy one, $U$ being the energy needed to add an electron to the orbital.

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{FillingPicture.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Exchange interaction diagram (I.2 in Laurent thesis)}
	\label{HybridEner}
	\end{figure}

	Doing this transformation is an important step, since we are now able to use a Heisenberg type spin hamiltonian instead of a hamiltonian mixing wave function, in addition to having the same formalism to write both type of exchange interactions, with just a difference in the exchange constants $I_{kk'}^{ex}$ and $I_{kk'}^{hyb}$.

	Supposing the coupling occur between two electrons with a close $k$ ($k \simeq k'$), we can rewrite $I_{kk'}^{hyb}$ as:
	\begin{align}
		\begin{array}{rl}
			I_{kk'}^{hyb} &= 2|V_{kd}|^2 \dfrac{U}{(E_k - E_d)(E_k - (E_d + U)} \\
						&= -2|V_{kd}|^2 \dfrac{U}{(E_k - E_d)(E_d + U - E_k}
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
Looking ath the Fig.~\ref{HybridEner}, one can see that $U$ and $E_k - E_d$ are both positive, while $E_k - (E_d + U)$. Thus, $I_{kk'}^{hyb}$ is negative, and we see that, while exchange lead to a ferromagnetic coupling, hybridization lead to an anti-ferromagnetic one. Their will be a competition in the semiconductor between these two for every type of carrier.

	Reusing the hypothesis done on Sec.~\ref{BandStruct} of small $k$ value, and the value of $V_{kd}$ presented in Eq.~\ref{Vkd}, we can rewrite the exchange constant:
	\begin{align}
		I_{00, \{c,v\}}^{hyb} = -2 \left(\frac{U}{(E_{\{c,v\}}(0) - E_d)(E_d + U - E_{\{c,v\}}(0))}\right) \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \Phi_r^* (\mathbf{r}) H_{HF} \psi_0^{\{c,v\}} \\
		I_{00, \{c,v\}}^{ex} = \int \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r} \mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}' \psi_0^{*\{c,v\}} (\mathbf{r}) \Psi_d^* \frac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 |\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}|\psi_0^{\{c,v\}} (\mathbf{r}) \Psi_d} (\mathbf{r})
	\end{align}
In the valence band, the semiconductor have the $p$ symmetry, as discussed in Sec.~\ref{BandStruct}. We then write $I_{pd}$ as the sum of the hybridization and the exchange contributions:
	\begin{align}
		I_{pd} =I_{00, v}^{hyb} +  I_{00, v}^{ex}
	\end{align}
In the conduction band, the orbital are $s$, and so we will write the interaction $I_{sd}$. However, since $s$ orbital have a spherical symmetry, there is no hybridization contribution. The expression is then pretty easy:
	\begin{align}
		I_{sd} = I_{00, c}^{ex}
	\end{align}

	Having define those, we can now rewrite the Hamiltonian of the interaction with one magnetic atom in the Heisenberg notation:
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{SQ} = {\cal H}_0 + I_{sd} \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{S} + I_{pd} \mathbf{J}.\mathbf{S}
	\end{align}
Since a DMS contain a small percentage of magnetic atoms, we can write the hamiltonian of the full semiconductor by summing on their position. We finally get:
	\begin{align}
	\label{HDMS}
		\begin{array}{rlcccc}
			{\cal H}_{DMS} &= {\cal H}_0 &+& \sum_i I_{sd} (\mathbf{R}_i) \bm{\upsigma}.\mathbf{S}_i &+& \sum_i I_{pd} (\mathbf{R}_i) \mathbf{J}.\mathbf{S}_i \\
							&= {\cal H}_0 &+& {\cal H}_{sd} &+& {\cal H}_{pd}
		\end{array}
	\end{align}

		\subsection{Mn case}
		
		For the Mn, we will rewrite the hamiltonian the exchange interaction in the valence band $I_{pd}$ as $I_{hMn}$ and $I_{sd}$ in the conduction band as $I_{eMn}$, since we look at the interaction between an exciton and the Manganese atom. The hamiltonian \ref{HDMS} is the rewrited:
		\begin{align}
		\label{HMnDMS}
			{\cal H}_{DMS, Mn} &= {\cal H}_0 + {\cal H}_{eMn} + {\cal H}_{hMn}
		\end{align}

		For the Cr, we will rewrite the hamiltonian the exchange interaction in the valence band $I_{pd}$ as $I_{hCr}$ and $I_{sd}$ in the conduction band as $I_{eCr}$, since we look at the interaction between an exciton and the Chromium atom. The hamiltonian \ref{HDMS} is the rewrited:

		The simple picture of the interaction between the electron of the semiconductor we get in Sec.~\ref{ExchDMS} using the Hartree-Fock approximation is not enough to understand the emission spectrum we get from our quantum dots. We need to go more into details. For a few paragraphs, we go back considering a semiconductor without magnetic atoms. As shown in \cite{ExchSplitInteratomic}, we can treat the interaction between one electron in the conduction band and the $N-1$ electron of the valence band as an interaction between this electron and the corresponding hole, with an adding exchange interaction. We can then write the exchange hamiltonian in a Heisenberg form as:
	\begin{align}
	\label{ehExchHamil}
		{\cal H}_{SC}^{exch} = I_{eh} \mathbf{J}.\bm{\upsigma}
	\end{align}
The matrix elements being:
	\begin{align}
		\langle e,h|{\cal H}_{SC}^{exch}| e', h' \rangle = \delta_{h,h'} \delta_{e, e'} (\epsilon_e - \epsilon_h) - K_{h'ee'h} + J_{eh'e'h}
	\end{align}
with $\epsilon_{e,h}$ the energy level of the electron and hole, $K_{h'ee'h}$ the direct exchange interaction and $J_{eh'e'h}$ the Coulomb exchange interaction.
	\newline

	[PLACEHOLDER]
	\newline
	
	Writing $\mathbf{J} = (J_z, J_+, J_-)$ with $J_+ = J_x + iJ_y$ and $J_- = J_x - iJ_y$, and $\bm{\upsigma} = (\sigma_z, \sigma_+, \sigma_-)$ with $\sigma_+ = \sigma_x + i\sigma_y$ and $\sigma_- = \sigma_x - i \sigma_y$, we can develop the hamiltonian \ref{ehExchHamil}:
	\begin{align}
	\label{Heh}
		\begin{array}{rll}
			{\cal H}_{e-h}^{exch} &= 2\delta_0 J_z \sigma_z &+ \dfrac{\delta_1}{2}\left(\exp (2i\varphi_1)j_+ \sigma_- - \exp (-2i\varphi_1)j_- \sigma_+ \right) \\
										& &+ \dfrac{\delta_2}{2}\left(\exp (2i\varphi_1)j_+ \sigma_+ + \exp (-2i\varphi_1)j_- \sigma_- \right)
		\end{array}
	\end{align}
with $\delta_0$ representing the splitting between dark and bright exciton, $\delta_1$ the splitting between the bright exciton states and $\delta_2$ the splitting between the dark exciton states.

	In order to get the full image of the polarization, the VBM mixing presented in Sec.~\ref{VBM} should also be taken into account. Exchange interaction favours a linear emission along $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_1 + 90^{\circ}$, while VBM orient the linear emission along $\theta$ and $\theta + 90^{\circ}$, as presented in Eq.~\ref{VBMPolar}. The competition between these two elements leads to an angle between the two different linearly polarized X lines different from $90^{\circ}$.

\chapter{Growth of the samples\label{Growth}}

	
	The sample were grown using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). This technique consist of heating cells containing the pure elements which will formed the semiconductor in order to sublimate or evaporate them, such as presented on Fig \ref{MBEScheme}. Once the element is at the right temperature, the cell is opened and the gas can travel in the chamber with a ballistic trajectory. The mean free path of this gas is long compared to the size of the cells and the chamber, allowing the atoms to condensate on the substrate without interacting before. Once reaching the surface, the atoms diffuse on it before stopping, either having dissipated their kinetic through interaction with the surface, or (more commonly) being kept by island of previously deposited atoms. In the ideal case, the growth occur layer by layer, slowly (about 1 monolayer/s), giving a good control of the thickness of the grown material.	

	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{02-GrowthQDs/Pictures/MBE.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Scheme of a MBE chamber and the position of the cells in regard of the substrate.}
	\label{MBEScheme}
	\end{figure}
	
	Since MBE is a slow growth process, it ask for ultra-vacuum condition, in the order of $10^{-8}$ Pa, to avoid any contamination of the sample. Each raw material is contained in a Knudsen cell, which consist of a crucibles of high-melting-point material with a low contaminating power (typically Pyrolytic Boron Nitride) wrapped in tungsten filament which will act as heater. A small shutter close the container, and is controlled by computer along each recipe sequences.
	
	This necessity of Ultra High Vacuum kept the MBE to be developed before the end of the 1960s \cite{FirstMBE}, although the the idea was formalized at the end of the 19th century. The good control on the growth this method offer make it really useful for the development of nanostructure and nanoscience. The deposition layer by layer give the possibility to grow really thin structure, and the transition between two materials can be really abrupt, on a few monolayer (ML). Growing nano-structure is still the main use of MBE. However, this method is mainly on research purpose, its slow growth speed and hard to fulfil growth conditions being an obstacle for the industrialization of the process.
	
	Another mode of MBE were used during the growth of the samples: Atomic Layer Epitaxy (ALE) or Migration-Enhanced Epitaxy (MEE). In this mode, the opening and closing of the cells are controlled during the growth in order to deposit one element at a time, with some time between each opening for the surface to relax. For CdTe, which was used to grow our QDs layer, a substrate temperature between 260$^{\circ}$C and 290$^{\circ}$C guaranty a growth of only 0.5 ML for each cycle, which is a complete sequence of opening and closing of the cells \cite{HMarALE}. This allow a small uncertainty on the substrate temperature while keeping a really good control on the growth of the sample.
	\newline
	
	In order to monitor each step of the growth, RHEED patterns of the sample surface were taken at different key moments. This technique require a high vacuum, a given since MBE ask for ultra-high vacuum condition, and the use of an electron gun able to produce high energy electron. The beam of the gun is sent at low angle, between 1$^{\circ}$ and 3$^{\circ}$, to the surface sample. This way, the electron will only probe the surface of the sample, entering the material only on a 3 or 4 ML. Therefore the detected pattern directly gives information on the flatness and the crystallinity of the surface. The detector, a CCD camera,  is set in order to collect only elastically scattered electrons.
	
	Incident electron have a wave vector $\mathbf{k_i} = 2 \pi / \lambda_e$, with $\lambda_e$ is the electron wavelength, typically 6 or 7 pm for an electron gun energy between 30 and 40 kV. Since only scattered diffraction is considered, the diffracted wave vector $\mathbf{k_f}$ as the same norm as the incident one $\mathbf{k_i}$. So the Ewald's Sphere has a radius equal to the norm of $\mathbf{k_i}$. In the reciprocal space, the plane of diffraction are infinite line. So, in the case of a perfect crystal, with a a perfect detector, the intersection with Ewald's sphere should be points. However, since the crystal can have some defect and neither the gun or the detector are perfect, the diffracted pattern present line, such as visible on Fig.\ref{RHEEDStep}(b).
	
	Once dots are grown, though, the surface become rough at the scale of the length of coherence of the beam. Therefore, the reciprocal space of the crystal is not line anymore. The electron can interact with several more layer while passing through the dots. This can be seen on the diffraction pattern, where lines become points, such as shown on Fig.\ref{RHEEDStep}(e).
	
	Another use of the RHEED diffraction is the monitoring of the number of layer grown through ALE. Focusing on the lowest angle reflected spot, called the specular spot, one can see small variation in the reflected intensity during the growth, showing oscillation through, such as presented on Fig.\ref{RHEEDOsc}. This intensity is minimal when there is half a ML grown, and maximal when the ML is fully grown. This is due to the variation of reflectivity of the surface: maximal for a flat surface, minimal for a rough one. Therefore, a period of these oscillation is exactly the growth of a single monolayer \cite{FirstRHEED,WoodRHEED}. We can also see the relaxation of a layer, if the variation of intensity disappear at a point.

	We studied to type of quantum dots: self assembled QDs, which have remaining strain on it, and strain free QDs. The strained dots are formed by the relaxation of a CdTe layer on ZnTe. Strain free dots are formed by thickness variation of a CdTe quantum well between CdMgTe barriers.
	
	%We are working with two sample holder, named "marked" and "unmarked", with slightly different temperature offset. The thermometer to measure the substrate temperature is placed at a few centimetre from the substrate holder, inducing another offset in the measured temperature.

		Sample holder in Tsukuba were flat plates of molybdenum, in which two screw holes were pierced. The two holes were used to fix two metallic rods which maintain the sample on the holder. This way, the sample didn't move or fall during the entry in the chamber or the growth. Two sample holders were available in Tsukuba, marked and unmarked, with a temperature offset difference of about 15$^{\circ}$C.
		
		The load lock chamber can hold to samples at the same time. Beginning at this stage, the sample were put upside down, in order for the sample to face the cells when entering the main chamber. Once the two samples holder were placed the load-lock chamber, it is pump and nitrogen gas is injected in.
		
		To put a sample holder in the main chamber, it was fixed to a transfer cane via a screw hole on his back. As shown on Fig.\ref{MBE}, the cell were placed on the lower part of the MBE machine, so the sample holder as to be put upside down in the main chamber in order to face them. Once in the chamber, the sample temperature was measured through a thermocouple at a few centimetre from the sample holder. This distance induced an offset on the measured temperature. This was important in the ALE to be in the temperature interval where 0.5 ML are grown each cycle. The temperature was therefore calibrated in order to grow the right number of monolayer for each growth (see part \ref{SKGrowth} and \ref{SFDGrowth}). The system being really stable in time, we kept this calibration for all the growth.
		
		The flux of each cells was calculated using Beam Equivalent Pressure (BEP) in the main chamber. The pressure in the main chamber was measured with a nude ionization gauge, both before and after having opened a single cell. Subtracting these two numbers gave us the BEP of the cell. The pressure in the main chamber was typically between $1.0 \times 10^{-9}$ Torr and $1.0 \times 10^{-8}$ Torr.
Since the growth speed depend on the flux of the cell, we used this method to control it: we first calibrate the growth speed in function of the pressure in the chamber, and then used these equivalence to control the growth process.
		
	\section{Strained dots: CdTe/ZnTE\label{SK}}
	
	\subsection{Substrate preparation}
	
		The sample was grown on ZnTe(100) substrates. We prepared the substrate by deosoxidizing them through an etching process. It was done in four steps. All of them, except the etching in Bromure-ethanol, occur in an ultrasonic cleaning device vibrating the sample at 43kHz and last 3 minutes. We began with  cleaning in acetone, followed by one in ethanol. The third step was the actual etching: the substrate was put in a solution of Bromure-ethanol, with 3\% of Bromure, during 1 minute. We finally rinsed it in methanol. Once rinsed, we keep the sample in ethanol until fixing them to the sample holder. The growth usually occur the day after the cleaning.
	
	\subsection{Strained dots growth\label{SKGrowth}}
	
	Before beginning the actual growth, after we entered the sample in the main chamber, we had to heat the cells and the sample, and to do the flux calibration for each cell. The targeted flux and heating speed are presented in Tab.\ref{FluxTempSK} for each cell used during the growth of strained QDs. 
	
	\begin{table}[h!]
	\begin{center}		
		\begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
			\hline
			Elements & Targeted BEP (Torr) \\ \hline
			Cd & $4.5\times10^{-7}$ \\
			Cr & N/A \\
			Te & $4.5\times10^{-7}$ \\
			Zn & $6.8\times10^{-7}$ \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Aimed flux for each cell during the growth of the strained QDs.}
		\label{FluxTempSK}
	\end{center}
	\end{table}
	
	It was shown that the to have a good quality of material, it was better to grow the ZnTe in excess of Zn \cite{TeEffect}. Otherwise, vacancies appear in the bulk, optically visible, and the surface is more rough. Moreover, the adsorption power of the Zn is smaller than the Te. For these reason, we choose to grow the ZnTe barriers in excess of Zn.
	
	When the sample is exposed to either Cd or Te flux during ALE, only one atomic layer will be deposited under each flux: we call this \emph{auto-regulated} growth. So, we chose the same flux for both of the compound \cite{HMarALE}. 
	
	Beginning the growth, the substrate temperature was initially raised to $320^{\circ}$C. The Zn cell shutter was open starting at $250^{\circ}$C, in order to flatten the surface for the growth. While it took several minutes to raise the substrate temperature, only one Zn layer can be deposited at a time. When the substrate temperature reach $320^{\circ}$C, the Te shutter was also open, in order to grow a ZnTe layer of about $420$ nm, at about $0.4$ ML.s$^{-1}$. This thick ZnTe layer guaranteed us to the best possible surface for the growth of the QD layer \cite{ChangZnTe}. Once done, we set up the RHEED, growing a few more ZnTe level while searching the specular spot. The substrate temperature was then lowered to $195^{\circ}$C (marked sample holder) or $180^{\circ}$C (unmarked sample holder), the Zn cell being open until the temperature reach $250^{\circ}$C. Then, the ALE began.

	\end{figure}
	
	One of the main difficulty of this work was to calibrate the Cr flux in order to trap only a single Cr atom in most of the QDs of the sample. To achieve so, the Cr density must be of the same order as the QDs density at the surface of the sample. This means a really small flux, with a BEP of some $10^{-10}$ Torr, which is about one order lower than the main chamber pressure and therefore not measurable with our technique. The optimisation was done starting with the know how acquired in Grenoble on the Mn and trying to optimise it for the Tsukuba machine, through a feedback loop with the micro-PL characterization in Grenoble.

	
	This really small flux was achieve by heating the Cr cell around 1000K, low compared to its sublimation temperature, and opening the cell only once during the ALE, for only 5s. In order to have big enough QDs, emitting at right wavelengths, we needed 6.5 ML of CdTe. Going above this number will create dislocation and defects in the layer, preventing it to relax correctly to form the QDs. To do so, we had to do 13 cycles of Cd and Te cells opening, since each cycle grew half a layer. However, these 6.5 ML of CdTe don't relax naturally: we had to deposit Te above and evaporate before seeing the formation of the dots \cite{TinjodMBE}. The Cr cells was opened during the 7th cycle, halfway through the growth of the QD layer, in order to allow the Cr atoms to diffuse without going out the QD layers. The whole ALE recipe to grow the QDs layer is given in the Fig.\ref{RecipeSK}.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]

	\end{center}
	\caption{Opening and closing cycles of each cell for the ALE of strained (Cd,Cr)Te samples.}
	\label{RecipeSK}
	\end{figure}

	Once the ALE was finished, we lowered the substrate temperature to $90^{\circ}$C to deposit the Te layer which formed the dots. It was deposited during 5 minutes. We then heated up the substrate again until $200^{\circ}$C, were we stayed for 20s in order to evaporate all the deposited Te \cite{WojnarMBE}. If the dots were formed, we saw a spotty pattern like the one presented on Fig.\ref{RHEEDStep} (f). The Zn and Te cells were then opened, while the substrate temperature was raised to $240^{\circ}$C in order to grow a protective layer about $350$ nm thick above the QDs.
	
	\section{Strain-free dots: CdTe/CdMgTe\label{SFD}}
		\subsection{Substrate preparation}
		
		The barrier for strain free samples are made of CdTe. The chosen substrate for the growth was GaAs, on which we grew a layer of about 3 $\mu$m of CdTe. Growing such a thick layer guaranty that the remaining strain are in the order of $0.1\%$ \cite{StrainRelaxCdTeGaAs111,StrainRelaxCdTeGaAs100}. Moreover, a small ZnTe layer was grown between GaAs and CdTe, which accelerated the relaxation of the strains \cite{StrainRelaxZnTeGaAs001}.
		
		For this sample, only a simple cleaning occur outside of the MBE machine. We did it in four steps, each of them lasting for 5 minutes in an ultrasonic cleaning device. We began with a cleaning acetone, at 43 kHz, followed by one in ethanol at the same frequency. We then put the substrate in water and clean it at 43 kHz. Finally, we changed the water and did the last step in water at 23 kHz, in order to clean the substrate from smaller dust particle.
		
		Since the surface of the GaAs is oxidized, no RHEED pattern was visible, as shown on Fig \ref{Hybrid}(a). The desoxidation was done in the MBE main chamber, in vacuum condition, using hydrogen radical (H$^*$). In order to form the radical gas, a hydrogen gas was ionized in a chamber by a RF power source of 300 W and with a frequency of 13.6 MHz. This gas composition is optically checked by probing the emission of the Balmer serie: for a pure hydrogen gas, peaks at 656 nm and 486 nm appear clearly. During the formation of this gas, the substrate temperature is raised to $400^{\circ}$C. Once the hydrogen chamber is full of H$^*$ gas, we initiate the rotation of the sample. Since the chamber was situated just under the main and linked to her, we just had to open the shutter between the two to send the radical gas onto the substrate. We exposed the substrate to this gas for 15 minutes, under a pressure of about $6\times10^{-7}$ Torr. We then checked the sample surface with RHEED, which should present a streak pattern with some dots as presented in Fig \ref{Hybrid}(b). 
		
		Once the cleaning of the sample was finished, we closed the H$^*$ gas chamber shutter, waited for the ultra-high vacuum to re-established in the main chamber and began the growth of the CdTe layer. We grew it in two times: one hour of growth just after the cleaning (described here) and about four hours just before the actual growth of  the quantum dots structure.
		
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=14cm]{02-GrowthQDs/Pictures/HybridSubstrate.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Left: Layer structure of the hybrid substrate with its protective Te cap.

	\label{Hybrid}
	\end{figure}
		
		This first part of the growth took place on a rotating sample. It only take about 15 ML of ZnTe on GaAs for the II-VI compound go back to its original lattice parameter \cite{StrainRelaxZnTeGaAs001}. Moreover, CdTe over ZnTe has a critical thickness of 5 ML \cite{CritThickCdTeZnTe}. So, to accelerate the relaxation of strain, we decided to grow a thing layer of ZnTe above the GaAs, before growing the CdTe thick layer. We lowered the substrate temperature to $320^{\circ}$C and opened the Zn cells for 30s with a BEP of $7.05\times10^{-7}$ Torr in order to flatten the surface. We then opened the Te cells, with a BEP of $5.21\times10^{-7}$ Torr, along with the Zn cell during 50s to grow the ZnTe layer in excess of Zn, making a layer about 7.2 nm thick.
		
		We then went to the growth of the first CdTe layer. We lowered again the substrate temperature to $250^{\circ}$C, under Zn flux. Once stabilized at the temperature, we closed Zn cells and open the Cd and Te cells for 1h. The Te cell had the same flux as previously, while the Cd cells had a flux of $4.72\times10^{-7}$ Torr. This layer was 633 nm thick, grown at 0.54 ML.s$^{-1}$. In order to protect the surface, we deposit an amorphous protective layer of Te above it, while decreasing the substrate temperature.
		
		\subsection{Unstrained dots growth\label{SFDGrowth}}
		
	As said in the introduction, the strain free dots are formed by thickness variation of a CdTe QW surrounded by CdMgTe barrier. In order to have to good confinement while keeping a close enough lattice constant, we chose to use Cd$_{0.7}$Mg$_{0.3}$Te. Therefore, the first step of the growth was to chose the flux for the growth. We went through a process of trial and error, growing several samples and testing their composition with Electron Probe Mico-Analysis and X-Ray diffraction, as well as the thickness grown with a step gauge, in order to estimate the growth speed. Since we wanted to grow Cd$_{0.7}$Mg$_{0.3}$Te, we began the test with a ration Te:Cd of 1:0.7 and a ratio Te:Mg of 1:0.3. After five round of adjustment, we achieve the growth of Cd$_{0.7}$Mg$_{0.3}$Te, settling with the targeted flux presented in Tab.\ref{FluxTempSFD}.
	For the settled Mg flux, the step gauge indicated a grown thickness of $520 \pm 5$ nm. Since we grew the test layer during 1h, we found a growing speed of about 0.15 nm.s$^{-1}$.
	\begin{table}[h!]
	\begin{center}		
		\begin{tabular}{| c | c |}
			\hline
			Elements & Targeted BEP (Torr) \\ \hline
			Cd & $4.5\times10^{-7}$ \\
			Cr & N/A \\
			Mg & $1.6\times10^{-8}$ \\
			Te & $5.26\times10^{-7}$ \\
			\hline
		\end{tabular}
		\caption{Aimed flux for each cell during the growth of the strained samples.}
		\label{FluxTempSFD}
	\end{center}
	\end{table}
	
	We began to heat the substrate temperature to 180$^{\circ}$, in order to remove the protective amorphous Te layer. We waited a few second at this temperature to remove all the deposited Te, and then resumed the heating to go to $250^{\circ}$C. Starting at $200^{\circ}$C, we opened the Te cells in order to stabilize the surface. When the substrate temperature was stabilized at $250^{\circ}$C, we opened the Cd cells and grew a 2.35 $\mu$m layer of CdTe, in order to reach the thickness of the relaxation of strains for CdTe/GaAs \cite{StrainRelaxCdTeGaAs111,StrainRelaxCdTeGaAs100}.
	
	In order to be sure that there will be no relaxation in the quantum, we choose to stick to the maximum cumulated thickness of the CdTe on a CdZnTe lattice, which has been shown to be lower than the one of CdTe on a CdMgTe lattice. This correspond to a maximum cumulated thickness of 130 nm \cite{CritThickCdTeCdZnTe}. We chose to grow 40 nm below the QW, and 90 nm above it, in order to have a thicker protective layer.

	Once the 40 nm barrier layer was grown, we lowered the substrate temperature under Te flux. Growing the QW layer in a Te environment smooth the surface layer of the sample and help having a flat surface to grow the well. Once the substrate temperature reach respectively $180^{\circ}$C (unmarked) or $195^{\circ}$C (marked), we began the ALE of the QW.
[insert explication on the Cr SFD ALE here]
The recipe is described in Fig.\ref{RecipeSFD}.

	\label{RecipeSFD}
	\end{figure}
We then raised the substrate temperature up to $250^{\circ}$C, under a Te flux, in order to proceed to the growth of the upper barrier, acting also as a protective layer. The opening time was there calculated to grow 90 nm of Cd$_{0.7}$Mg$_{0.3}$Te.

\chapter{Magneto-optical study of Cr-doped CdTe quantum dots\label{MagOptStud}}

	In this chapter, we will study the photoluminescence of a II-VI quantum dot containing a single Chromium atom. We saw in the chap.~\ref{CrSemiCon} that the magnetic anisotropy of the spin lead to a zero magnetic field splitting of the $0$, $\pm 1$ and $\pm 2$ states. In a neutral Cr-doped quantum dot, such an anisotropy is induced by the bi-axial strains in the plane of the dots. Probing optically the dot, it results that exchange interaction is enough to see the effect of the presence of a single Cr spin in the QD. Studying the magnetic-field dependence of the quantum dots photoluminescence, we will also show the influence of the symmetry on carrier-Cr spin coupling.

	\section{Strained quantum dots containing an individual Cr atom}
	
		\subsection{Energy structure of a Cr in a quantum dot}
		
		Using the procedure described in the chap.~\ref{SKGrowth}, we randomly incorporated Cr atom in CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots, adjusting the density of the Cr atoms to be roughly equal to the density of dots, in order to get QDs containing 0, 1 or a few Cr atoms. The photoluminescence (PL) of individual QDs, induced by optical excitation with a dye laser tuned on resonance with an excited state of the dots, is studied by optical micro-spectroscopy.
		
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=15cm]{04-CrMagOpt/Pictures/Spectras.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{(a) PL of QD1 X-Cr complex at low temperature (T=5K). Inset presents the PLE map of this QD, showing a sharp quasi-resonant state for an excitation at 2100 meV. (b) PL of QD2 X-Cr complex at low temperature. (c) PL of QD3 X-Cr complex at low temperature.}
	\label{SpectraX}
	\end{figure}

	Low temperature (T=5K) PL of the neutral exciton (X-Cr) of several QD doped with a single Cr are reported in Fig.~\ref{SpectraX}. Four emission lines are observed as shown in QD3, with the central peak being split in some QDs, such as QD1 and QD2 spectra. Scanning with an energy tunable laser, we saw that all the peaks share a common quasi-resonant state, where all are at a maximum intensity, as highlighted in the inset of Fig.~\ref{SpectraX}(a). This is an indication that they originate from the same dot. Variations in the relative intensities of the peaks are observed in different dots. The lowest energy peak is shown as getting more intense  when the splitting of the central peak get wider.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{04-CrMagOpt/Pictures/EnLvl.png}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Illustration of the energy levels of the ground state (Cr), the bright exciton states ($|\pm1\rangle$) coupled to the spin of a Cr (X-Cr) and dominant PL transitions ($\sigma$+, $\sigma$-). The states $|$S$_z = \pm2\rangle$ cannot be populated through thermalization, and thus the recombination channel are not shown on this schema.}
	\label{CrEnergyStruct}
	\end{figure}

	In a II-VI semiconductor, the orbital momentum of the Cr connects the spin of the atom to its local strain environment through the modification of the crystal field and the spin-orbit coupling. For biaxial strain in the (001) plane, the ground state of a Cr spin is split by a strain induced magnetic anisotropy term ${\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon_\parallel}=D_0S^2_z$ (see chap.~\ref{CrSemiCon}). It was deduced from electron paramagnetic resonance of bulk Cr-doped CdTe that $D_0$ is positive for compressive biaxial strain~\cite{EPRCr}. In a self-assembled CdTe/ZnTe QD with large in-plane strain, the Cr spin energy levels are split with S$_z$=0 at low energy (Fig.~\ref{CrEnergyStruct}). A value of $D_0$ in the 1 meV range can be expected for a CdTe layer strained on a ZnTe substrate, as shown in chap.~\ref{CrSemiCon}.
	
	When an electron-hole (e-h) pair is injected in a Cr-doped QD, the bright excitons are split by the exchange interaction between the spins of Cr and carriers. In flat self-assembled QDs, the heavy-holes and light-holes are separated in energy by the biaxial strain and the confinement. In a first approximation, the ground state in such QD is a pure heavy-hole (J$_z$=$\pm$3/2) exciton and the exchange interaction with the Cr spin S is described by the spin Hamiltonian 
	\begin{align}
		{\cal H}_{c-Cr}=I_{eCr}\vec{S}\cdot\vec{\sigma}+I_{hCr}S_zJ_z
	\end{align}		
with $\vec{\sigma}$ the electron spin and J$_z$ the hole spin operator. I$_{eCr}$ and I$_{hCr}$ are, respectively, the exchange integrals of the electron and the hole spins with the Cr spin. These exchange energies depend on the exchange constant of the $3d$ electrons of the Cr with the carriers in CdTe and on the overlap of the Cr atom with the confined carriers. The exchange interaction of the Cr spin is ferromagnetic for both electron and hole spins in common II-VI semiconductors and a typical exchange constant 4 to 5 times larger for the holes than for the electrons is also expected in CdTe~\cite{DMSCrExchInt,CdCrSExchInt}.
	
	For highly strained CdTe/ZnTe QDs with a weak hole confinement, the strain induced energy splitting of the Cr spin $D_0S^2_z$ is much larger than the exchange energy with the confined carriers ($D_0\gg |I_{hCr}|>|I_{eCr}|$). The exchange interaction with the exciton acts as an effective magnetic field which further splits the Cr spins states S$_z$=$\pm$1 and S$_z$=$\pm$2. The resulting X-Cr energy levels are presented in Fig.~\ref{CrEnergyStruct}. The exciton recombination does not affect the Cr atom and its spin is conserved during the optical transitions. Consequently, the large strain induced splitting of the Cr spin is not directly observed in the optical spectra. However, at low temperature, the Cr spin thermalize on the low energy states S$_z$=0 and S$_z$=$\pm$1. This leads to a PL dominated by three contributions: a central line corresponding to S$_z$=0 and the two outer lines associated with S$_z$=$\pm$1 split by the exchange interaction with the carriers.

(d) Illustration of the energy levels of the ground state (Cr), the bright exciton states ($|\pm1\rangle$) coupled to the spin of a Cr (X-Cr), showing the splitting of the central peak via the bright exciton coupling, and dominant PL transitions ($\sigma$+ (blue), $\sigma$- (red) and $\pi$ (green and black)).}
	\label{CrLinPolar}
	\end{figure}
	
	Cr-doped quantum dots exhibit a linear polarization dependence, as presented in Fig.~\ref{CrLinPolar}. The central line (S$_z$=0) is split and linearly polarized along two orthogonal directions. As in non-magnetic QDs, this results from a coupling of the two bright excitons $|\pm1\rangle$ by (i) the short range e-h exchange interaction in the presence of valence band mixing and/or (ii) the long-range e-h exchange interaction in a QD with an in-plane shape anisotropy~\cite{SplitInvTh}. This anisotropic e-h exchange energy mixes the bright exciton associated with the same Cr spin state, inducing an extra splitting between them. The mixing is maximum for the central pair of bright excitons (S$_z$=0) which are initially degenerated. The outer lines are also slightly linearly polarized but the influence of the e-h exchange interaction is attenuated by the initial splitting of the $|\pm1\rangle$ excitons induced by the exchange interaction with the Cr spin S$_z$=$\pm1$.

	\caption{Time resolved PL of QD2 taken on two exterior peaks, attributed to $|S_z = +1\rangle$ and $|S_z = -1\rangle$ (noted (1) and (3) in Fig.~\ref{CrLinPolar}(a)), and the lower energy one (noted (4)).}
	\label{CrDecay}
	\end{figure}

	In order to identify the lower energy peak ((4) in Fig.~\ref{CrLinPolar}(a)), we took the time resolved photoluminescence of the emission peaks, presented in Fig.~\ref{CrDecay}. One can notice that the line (4) present a decay time about twice as long as the high energy peak. A long recombination time is one of the characteristics of a dark exciton emission~\cite{DELongLifetime}. Under normal circumstances, the recombination of such a state is non-radiative. However, it is possible to observe a dark exciton recombination emitting a photon in low symmetry quantum dot~\cite{DELum}. This hypothesis will be confirmed by the magneto-optical study of the dot presented in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptExp} and \ref{CrMagOptMod}.

	\label{CrTemp}
	\end{figure}	
	
	Since the absence of PL on $|\pm2\rangle$ is linked to their impossibility to be thermally populated, one could expect to see their emission at higher temperature. Fig.~\ref{CrTemp} presents the dot PL at several temperatures. With the increase of the temperature, we observe a significant line broadening induced by the interaction with acoustic phonons. In order to keep a significant PL intensity and resolved PL lines, we limited our investigation to temperature below 50K. No contribution of the $|$S$_z$=$\pm2\rangle$ Cr spins states are observed in the emission of the exciton.
		


		\subsection{Excited states of a Cr-doped QD}
			
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=15cm]{04-CrMagOpt/Pictures/PLEDotPres.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{(a) PL spectra of the exciton in QD2 (X-Cr) for co-circularly (blue) and cross-circularly (red) polarized excitation/detection [À VÉRFIER : taken on the 2175 meV quasi-resonant state]. (b) - (c) PLE map between 2046 meV and 2013 meV presenting several excited, detecting in $\sigma_{co}$ (b) and $\sigma_{cross}$ (c).}
	\label{PLEDotPres}
	\end{figure}

	In order to study the different excited states presented by a QD doped with a single Cr atom, we took the PLE of QD2 starting close the dot. The dot spectra is presented in Fig.~\ref{PLEDotPres}(a) in both $\sigma$ polarizations. The central peaks do not show dependency in circular polarization, which is coherent with their linear polarization dependency presented in Fig.~\ref{CrLinPolar}(a) and (b). The excitation laser is $\sigma$+ polarized in order to control the spin of the injected exciton. The exterior peaks emission being in $\sigma$+ polarization shows that there is no spin flip of the exciton before recombination.
	
	Fig.~\ref{FullPLE}(a) presents the entire PLE of QD2 X-Cr complex. However, one can note several other excited states along the scan. In this section, we will discuss several of them.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=14cm]{04-CrMagOpt/Pictures/FullPLEv2.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{(a) QD2 X-Cr PLE map in $\sigma_{cross}$ polarization. Several excited states are highlighted. (b) PLE scan of the lower energy peak, taken close to the QD emission energy, showing the phonon replica taken in $\pi$ detection. The emission integrated intensity in function of the laser energy is plotted in (c) (black curve) along with the PL spectra of QD2 taken in $\sigma_{co}$ polarization. (d) PLE map between 2046 meV and 2013 meV presenting several excited, detecting in $\pi$. (d) Zoom in a particular excited state presented a splitting inversion, taken in $\pi$ detection.}
	\label{FullPLE}
	\end{figure}
	
	The first remarkable feature of this scan is the really long luminescence of the acoustic phonon replica. As shown on the zoom in Fig.~\ref{FullPLE}(b), the probed peak continues to emit with an excitation several millielectronvolt above the excited state, remaining visible until 2004 meV. One can also see two sharp intensity diminutions in this emission. Mapping the intensity of this peak emission to the quantum dot spectrum (Fig.~\ref{FullPLE}(c)), it is evidenced that these diminutions occur when the laser is in resonance with a QD emission line. The absorption then preferentially occurs in this resonantly excited state than in the acoustic phonon band.
	
	
	At higher excitation energy, several excited states appear. The lower energy one is around 2018.5 meV, zoomed in on Fig.~\ref{FullPLE}(e). On this excited state, each peak presents a slightly different resonant energy. One can see that the order of appearance of the two central peaks seems to be reversed compared to the external ones. This phenomenon was first observed on QDs in GaAs quantum well~\cite{FineStructSplitGaAsdots}. This indicates an inversion of the splitting due to electron-hole exchange interaction~\cite{SplitInvTh}.
	
	Another excited state can be saw at 2025 meV. This excited state occurs on a large energy band and can be linked back to an excitation to the optical phonon. Looking at the $\sigma$ polarized emission of this state (Fig.~\ref{PLEDotPres}(b) and (c)), we can see that this excitation presents a really good spin conservation: the low and high energy peaks are strongly $\sigma$ polarized, while the central peaks do not show dependency over circular polarization. This, once again, show the good spin conservation of the system, as highlighted on the quasi-resonant state. 
	
	Finally, another interesting excited state appear at 2030 meV. This state presents an exchange-induced splitting  different from the splitting in the quasi-resonant state. This is due to a difference in the carriers and Cr atom wavefunction overlap. One can also noticed the this state presents a stronger luminescence in $\sigma_{cross}$ than in $\sigma_{co}$, [TO REDISCUSS] hinting at a spin flip of the hole before the recombination.
		
		\subsection{Magneto-optics of a quantum dot doped with a single Cr}
		
	The structure of the energy levels in Cr-doped QDs is confirmed by the evolution of the PL spectra in magnetic field (up to 11T) in Faraday configuration~\cite{BesombesPumpMnSFD}, presented in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptExp}. One can see that the Zeeman energy of the exciton under magnetic field can compensate the exciton splitting induced by the exchange interaction with the Cr~\cite{LegerQDGeomEffect}. For QD3, this results in an anti-crossing of $|+1\rangle$ and $|-1\rangle$ excitons due to the e-h exchange interaction around B$_z$=6 T observed both in $\sigma$+ and $\sigma$- polarizations (anti-crossing (2) and (3) in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptExp}(a)).
		
	\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{04-CrMagOpt/Pictures/MagOptv2.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{(a) Circularly polarized X-Cr PL evolution under magnetic field (B$_z$) in QD1. Noticeable anti-crossing  are highlighted and numbered. (b) QD1 X-Cr PL spectra taken at 0 and $\pm10$T.}
	\label{CrMagOptExp}
	\end{figure}
		
		The low energy emission presented as a dark exciton in Fig.~\ref{CrDecay} shows an anti-crossing with the bright excitons under B$_z$ in $\sigma$- polarization (anti-crossing (4) in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptExp}). As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptMod}(b), this anti-crossing arises from a mixing of the bright and dark excitons interacting with the same Cr spin state. Observed in $\sigma$- polarization, it corresponds to the mixing of the exciton states $|-1\rangle$ and $|+2\rangle$ coupled to the Cr spin S$_z$=-1. This dark/bright excitons coupling $\delta_{12}$ is induced by the e-h exchange interaction in a confining potential of reduced symmetry (lower than C$_{2v}$)~\cite{DERecombTh}. In such symmetry, the dark exciton acquire an in-plane dipole moment which lead to possible optical recombination at zero magnetic field~\cite{DELum} as observed in these QDs. The oscillator strength of this "dark exciton" increases as the initial splitting between $|-1\rangle$ and $|+2\rangle$ excitons is reduced by the magnetic field (Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptMod}(b)).
		
		\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=10cm]{04-CrMagOpt/Pictures/MagOptLowSym.eps}
	\end{center}
	\caption{Linear polarization intensity map (top panel) and intensity map of the longitudinal magnetic field dependence of the emission (bottom panel) of (a) X$^2$-Cr and (b) X-Cr in QD3.}
	\label{CrMagOptLowSym}
	\end{figure}
		
		To illustrate the influence of the QD symmetry on the magneto-optical properties of X-Cr, we show in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptLowSym}(b) the emission of a QD with a different strain state (QD4). For QD3, the splitting of the central peak is not clear in the PL at 0T (Fig.~\ref{SpectraX}(a)) without the linear polarization map, while two linearly polarized peaks appears clearly in QD4 spectra. This difference in emission arise from a difference in the in-plane strain of each QD~\cite{SplitInvTh}. The dark exciton emission is also stronger in QD2, confirming a lower symmetry than QD3.
		
		Investigating both the biexciton and the exciton in the same Cr-doped QD, we can also analyze the impact of the carrier-Cr interaction on the fine structure of the Cr spin. The magnetic field dependency of X$^2$-Cr emission in QD2 is presented along with the X-Cr emission as a contour plot in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptLowSym}(a) and (b) respectively. The PL under magnetic field of X-Cr and X$^2$-Cr present a mirror symmetry. In particular, the dark/bright exciton mixing observed around $B_z$=2.5T on the low energy side of the PL in $\sigma-$ polarization for X-Cr is observed on the high energy side in $\sigma+$ polarization for X$^2$-Cr (circles in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptLowSym}(a) and (b)).
		
		If one consider the ground state of X$^2$ as a spin-singlet (total spin 0), it cannot be split by the magnetic field or the spin interaction part of the carriers-Cr Hamiltonian. The creation of two excitons in the QD cancels the exchange interaction with the Cr atom. Thus, the PL of  X$^2$-Cr is controlled by the final state of the optical transitions, i.e. the eigenstates of X-Cr, resulting in the observed mirror symmetry in the PL spectra. However, in some of the QDs, the X$^2$-Cr emission slightly deviates from this simple picture: a smaller energy splitting is observed for X$^2$-Cr compared to X-Cr (see X-Cr and X$^2$-Cr in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptLowSym}). This shows that there is an interaction of X$^2$ with the Cr atom. It could result from a perturbation of the carriers' wave function by the interaction with the magnetic atom~\cite{CarInSpinSplit,BiexFinStruct} or a modification the local electric field which controls the Cr fine structure.

	We calculated the magneto-optic behaviour of Cr-doped QDs by diagonalizing the complete Hamiltonian of the e-h-Cr in self-assembled dots. This hamiltonian can be separated as follows:
	
	\begin{align}
\label{X-Cr} {\cal H}_{X-Cr}={\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon}+{\cal H}_{c-Cr}+{\cal H}_{mag}+{\cal H}_{e-h}+{\cal H}_{band}+{\cal H}_{scat}

${\cal H}_{Cr,\varepsilon}$ describes the fine structure of the Cr atom and its dependency on local strain, as presented in Eq.~\ref{Cralone}. It is mainly drived by $D_0$, the magnetic anisotropy. E, the in-plane strains, also appears in this Hamiltonian, but have to be kept small in order to model the found dots (see Fig.~\ref{CrHighE} for the emission of a dot with a higher E).

${\cal H}_{c-Cr}$ describes the coupling of the electron and hole with the Cr spin, depending on $I_{eCr}$, the exchange integral of the electron-Cr spins, and $I_{hCr}$, the exchange integral of the hole-Cr spins, as described in Eq.~\ref{HCrDMS}.

${\cal H}_{mag}$ describes the effect of an exterior magnetic field, coupled to both the Cr and carrier spins by the Zeeman terms, depending on the $g$-factor of each of them and the Bohr magneton $\mu_B$, and including the diamagnetic shift of the electron-hole via the term $\gamma$.
\begin{align}
	{\cal H}_{mag} = g_{Cr}\mu_B\overrightarrow{B}.\overrightarrow{S}+g_{e}\mu_B\overrightarrow{B}.\overrightarrow{\sigma}+g_{h}\mu_B\overrightarrow{B}.\overrightarrow{J}+\gamma B^2
\end{align}

${\cal H}_{e-h}$ describes the short range and long range electron-hole interaction, through the bright and dark exciton splitting $\delta_0$, the bright exciton coupling $\delta_1$, the dark exciton coupling $\delta_2$ and the bright and dark exciton coupling $\delta_{11}$ and $\delta_{12}$. All of these term are described in Eq~\ref{Heh}.

${\cal H}_{band}$, the band Hamiltonian, presented in Eq.~\ref{HBand}, stands for the energy of the electrons (i.e. the band gap energy $E_g$), and the heavy-holes (hh) and light-holes (lh) energies, depending on the splitting between lh and hh $\Delta_{lh}$, and the anisotropy of the QD.

${\cal H}_{scat}$ describes the perturbation of the wave function of the exciton in the initial state of the optical transition by the hole-Cr exchange interaction, controlled by the parameter $\eta$. This perturbation depends on the value of the exchange energy between the Cr spin $S_z$  and the hole spin $J_z$ and can be represented, using second order perturbation theory, by an effective spin Hamiltonian \cite{CarInSpinSplit,BiexFinStruct,DynhMn}
\begin{align}
{\cal H}_{scat}=-\eta S_z^2
\end{align}
\noindent with $\eta>0$.

	We considered the general case of QDs with a symmetry lower than C$_{2v}$ (truncated ellipsoidal lens for instance~\cite{DERecombTh}), and took into account the influence of this reduced symmetry on the valence band and on the e-h exchange interaction. The population of the X-Cr spin states split by the large magnetic anisotropy and the carriers-Cr exchange interaction is described by a spin effective temperature T$_{eff}$. The results of the model obtained with T$_{eff}$=25K, D$_0$=2.5 meV and an electron-Cr (hole-Cr) exchange interaction I$_{eCr}$=-70$\mu$eV (I$_{hCr}$=-280 $\mu$eV) are reported in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptMod} (parameters not specific to Cr-doped QDs are listed in Tab.~\ref{CrModelParam}). Such parameters do not aim to fit the data and are only reasonable order of magnitude. The PL of X-Cr at zero field and its evolution in magnetic field can be qualitatively reproduced. In particular, the description of the spin states occupation by T$_{eff}$ is sufficient to reproduce the observed emission from the three low energy X-Cr levels (Cr spin states S$_z$=0 and S$_z$=$\pm$1). The splitting of the central line at zero field (anti-crossing (1)) and the anti-crossings under magnetic field (anti-crossings (2) and (3) around B$_z$=6T for the Cr spin states S$_z$=+1 and anti-crossings (4) with the dark exciton around B$_z$=2T) are also well reproduced by the model.

	The magnetic anisotropy D$_0$ cannot be precisely extracted from the PL spectra. However, a higher value would produce a smaller PL intensity of the sates S$_z$=$|\pm1\rangle$ than observed experimentally. In addition, for D$_0$ $<$ 2.25 meV, an anti-crossing due to an electron-Cr flip-flop controlled by I$_{eCr}$, labelled (5) in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptMod}(c), would appear below B$_z$=11T on the central line in $\sigma$+ polarization.
	
	Having shown that our model reproduce well the evolution of the emission under variations of different parameters, we can run it to see the influence of E on the emission. This simulation was done by applying a small magnetic anisotropy D$_x$ along the $x$ axis of the quantum dot and none along the $y$ axis (D$_y$=0), creating an effective E. Results of such a study are presented on Fig.~\ref{CrHighE}, (a) and (b) for the X-Cr system, and (c) and (d) for the X$^c$-Cr one.

	The X-Cr map in linear polarization presents a dependency on all the three peaks at 0T, when only the central  peaks exhibit this behaviour in dots with a small in-plane anisotropy at the Cr position. The effect of such an anisotropy is to coupled to spin levels separated by two spin units, such as $|S_z = -1\rangle$ and $|S_z = +1\rangle$. This induce a mixing between two bright exciton states, leading to a linearly polarized emission. For a low E value, the strain induced splitting of $|S_z = \pm 1\rangle$ is high enough to strongly reduce the mixing of the exciton states. A higher in-plane strain anisotropy is able to couple the spin level and induced the linearly polarized emission.

	
	As can be expected, X$^c$-Cr doesn't present any linear polarization dependency, as shown on Fig.~\ref{CrHighE}(c).
	
	The evolution of the emission under magnetic field also presents different characteristics than a QD with magnetic anisotropy purely along z. Fig.~\ref{CrHighE}(b) presents the evolution in B of the X-Cr emission. 
One can note anti-crossings at +5T appearing on both $|S_z = +1\rangle$ and $|S_z = -1\rangle$, as well as an anti-crossing at -5T appearing on the low energy emission lines. These are similar to the anti-crossing (2), (3) and (4) on Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptMod}. Around 0T, other anti-crossings appear, on all the three peaks this time. Anti-crossing on the central peaks is the same as the anti-crossing (1) in Fig.~\ref{CrMagOptMod}. The ones appearing on the $|S_z = \pm 1\rangle$ peaks arise from the exciton mixing via E, as evidenced by the linear polarization.

	X$^c$-Cr in dot with high in-plane anisotropy at the Cr position also presents anti-crossing for a magnetic field around 1T, as shown in Fig.~\ref{CrHighE}(d). This anti-crossing appears when the Zeeman effect of the Cr atom compensates the electron-Chromium interaction and the hole-Chromium interaction.
				
	
	\section{Charge fluctuation of a Cr ion  in the vicinity  of the QDs}
	
	Some dots were found presenting a linear polarization dependency both on their central peaks and on their exterior peaks. However, such dots didn't present any anti-crossing when probed under magnetic field. Results of these experiments are presented in Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksMagOpt}.
	
	\begin{figure}[h!]

	\label{CrSixPeaksMagOpt}
	\end{figure}
	
	A common feature of all of these dots is the thin and well split X$^+$-Cr PL structure, shown on Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksMagOpt}(a) around 1949mev. X-Cr and X$^2$-Cr also present three well defined peaks, with a broad emission. This is not a general case, as some dots were found presenting a broad emission on X-Cr and X$^2$-Cr positions, such as QD6 presented in Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksSplit}. The linear polarization map of the PL of QD4 reveals that each peak presents a linear polarization dependency (Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksMagOpt}(b) and (c)).
	
	The PL evolution of such a dot is presented in Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksMagOpt}(d). The  diamagnetic shift is clearly visible. However, the only anti-crossings appear at B=9T for all the peaks (zoom in Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksMagOpt}(d)). Such anti-crossings are characteristic of an exciton in a QD with no magnetic atom: it arise from the dark and bright exciton mixing.

	\label{CrSixPeaksEFieldX+}
	\end{figure}	
	
	In order to get more informations on these dots, it was decided to study them applying a bias voltage. The application of an electric field was realized via a sample with a Schottky gate in the same fashion than the one in chap.~\ref{ChargeSelec}. The resulting map is presented in Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksEFieldX+}(a). The first visible feature is the strong electric field dependency of the emission energy, more marked for X-Cr than for the X$^c$-Cr systems. The emission energy variation of the X-Cr complex occur on a 2.9 meV scale.
	
	There is another remarkable point on these maps, evidenced on the X$^+$-Cr complex on the Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksEFieldX+}(b): the splitting between each peak is changing with the applied electric field. The splitting between the high and low energy peaks varies from 0 meV for an applied bias voltage of -12V (no splitting) to 0.76 meV for 13V applied. This disappearance of the splitting for a certain bias voltage indicates that the overlap between the electron and the hole wave functions is changed by the application of an exterior electric field, to the point where they don't overlap at all.

(c)-(d) Circular PL for an applied bias voltage of, respectively, 0V and -2.5V.}
	\label{CrSixPeaksSplit}
	\end{figure}
		
	Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksSplit} shows that, using electric field, we can manipulate the splitting of any given charged state of the QD. For all positive bias voltage between 0V and 13V, X-Cr present a broad emission containing all six peaks in linear emission, as show on Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksSplit}(a). The emission then divide into three distinct peaks, starting to appear around -1V. This is evidenced on the the PL emission on Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksSplit}(d).

	\end{figure}
	
	This three peaks emission structure looks like a three levels system emitting at three different energies. However, the magnetic field evolution presented in Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksMagOpt}(c) does not reflect the presence of a magnetic atom in the quantum dot. Moreover, evolution under electric field shows huge changes in the carriers wave functions overlap. These features hint for a single exciton trapped in the QD, presenting spectral fluctuations.
	
	Spectral fluctuations under a fluctuation of charge in the vicinity of a QD has been observed to lead to a peak broadening~\cite{ChargeSpectFluct}, such as observed on Fig.~\ref{CrSixPeaksSplit}(d), as well as spectrum jumps. For the PL to jump between three emission energies, the charge fluctuation has to be able to take three distinct charge values.
	
	Cr in ZnTe is incorporated as Cr$^{2+}$, but, as shown on Fig.\ref{CrOutsideDot}(a), the Cr$^+$ and Cr$^{3+}$ are also accessible~\cite{CrZnTe}, either by capturing an electron (Cr$^+$) or a hole (Cr$^{3+}$). Considering such a charge close to the QD, it can be viewed as a punctual one, since the dot is far bigger than the atom. The effect on the wave functions, presented in Fig.\ref{CrOutsideDot}(b)-(d), differs depending on the electrical charge of the Cr atom. The electron is well confined in CdTe/ZnTe quantum dots, while the hole is almost not confined. Because of this, the electron wave function is almost not moved by the presence of the electric, when the hole one vary more depending on the charge state of the Cr. These differences in the overlapping of wave functions lead to three different emission energies depending on the Cr charge state.
	
	The charge variation of the Cr is of the value of the elementary charge. Considering a pure coulomb interaction between two punctual charges, for a charge at 5nm of the dot, its effect is one order of magnitude below the confinement energy. In order to have a significant effect on the dot PL, the Cr has then to be close to it, not more than a few nanometres away. 
	
	This hypothesis is currently tested, along with the capacity for the Cr to diffuse outside the quantum dots layer.
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	
	For the first time, a single Cr atom in a semiconductor was probed optically. The fine structure of the Cr is dominated by a magnetic anisotropy induced by strain in the plane of the QDs. The large spin to strain coupling of Cr, two orders of magnitude larger than for magnetic elements without orbital momentum (NV centers in diamond \cite{SpinMechaDriv}, Mn atoms in II-VI semiconductors \cite{LafuenteStrainMn}) suggests some possible development of coherent mechanical spin-driving of an individual magnetic atom in a nano-mechanical oscillator. This new single spin system should allow, at low temperature, to enter some coupling regimes dominated by quantum coherent dynamics not reached until now in hybrid spin-mechanical devices.
	
	Some dots presents the same structure at 0T than dots containing a single Cr atom, but without presenting the signature of the presence of a magnetic atom under magnetic field. These dots are effected by the variation of charge of a single Cr atom in the barrier, close to the dot. Further study of the diffusion process of Cr in CdTe and ZnTe is required in order to avoid the creation of such dots.

	\section{Cr spin time fluctuations}
	
		\subsection{Autocorrelation: conservation of the Cr spin}

	\label{AutocorExpCr}
	\end{figure}		
		
		To observe the time fluctuations of the Cr spin under CW optical excitation, we used the statistics of time arrivals of the photons emitted by a Cr-doped QD given by the second order correlation function g$^{(2)}(\tau)$ of the PL intensity. Fig.~\ref{AutocorExpCr} shows g$^{(2)}(\tau)$ for the lines (1), (3) and (4) recorded in circular polarization. These signals are compared with the auto-correlation obtained for the PL of a non-magnetic QD which is characteristic of a single-photon emitter with a dip (anti-bunching) at short delays. The width of the anti-bunching is given by the lifetime of the emitter and the generation rate of excitons and its depth is limited by the time resolution of the HBT setup. As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{AutocorExpCr}, typical non-magnetic CdTe/ZnTe QDs do not present any significant bunching induced by charge fluctuations \cite{QDAutocor,IndistPhoton}. A similar auto-correlation on a X-Cr PL line still presents a reduced coincidence rate near zero delay, but it is mainly characterized by a large photon bunching with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) in the 20 ns range. This large bunching reflects an intermittency in the emission of a given line of the QD coming from fluctuations of the Cr spin in a 10 ns timescale as it will be confirmed by cross-correlation measurements.

The amplitude of the bunching reaches 5 for line (1) and is slightly weaker for the lower energy lines. In a simple picture of blinking where the selected QD line can be either in a state ON or OFF, the amplitude of the bunching is given by $\Gamma_{OFF}/\Gamma_{ON}$, ratio of the transition rates from OFF to ON, $\Gamma_{ON}$, and from ON to OFF, $\Gamma_{OFF}$ \cite{SubnanoSpectDiff}. An amplitude of bunching larger than 1 is then expected in a multilevel spin system where, after a spin relaxation, multiple spin-flips are usually required to come back to the initial state ($\Gamma_{ON}<\Gamma_{OFF}$). Let us finally note that the bunching signal is not affected by a weak transverse magnetic field ($B_x=0.42$T in Fig.~\ref{AutocorExpCr}). This confirms the presence of a large strain induced magnetic anisotropy $D_0$ which splits the Cr and X-Cr states and blocks their precession in a magnetic field.

		\subsection{Power dependency: relaxation paths}

	\caption{Excitation power variations on dot334 QD3 and plot of the intensity of each peak}
	\label{CrSpectraPwExp}
	\end{figure}
	
	In order to study the different relaxation path of the system, probing of the emission evolution under excitation power was realized, reported on Fig.~\ref{CrSpectraPwExp}. As expected, the PL is becoming more intense with the augmentation of the excitation laser, since more exciton are produced and thus injected in the quantum dot. However, this power augmentation response is not the same for each of the peaks. The two central peaks, associated with the $|0\rangle$ states, start at about twice the intensity of the $|\pm1\rangle$ peaks for the most intense one, seemingly never reaching their maximum under our power range. However, when lowering the excitation power, they diminish quickly, and even seems to disappear at low energy, when exterior peaks still show luminescence. Plotting this evolution shows that the two central peaks exhibit a super-linear evolution. On the other side, the exterior peaks begin by rising in intensity before diminishing in a sub-linear fashion. This is coherent with the usual picture, where high power populating preferentially X$^2$-Cr states, while low power populates preferentially X-Cr states~\cite{??}. Finally, one can notice that the dark exciton exhibit the same behaviour, but the maximum emission intensity is at slightly lower power than the $|\pm1\rangle$.

	\label{CrSpectraPwMod}
	\end{figure}
	
	The results of this evolution are well reproduced by our spin effective Hamiltonian, using the parameters found for the dot from the magneto-optics and the linear polarization fitting. The model results are presented in Fig.~\ref{CrSpectraPwMod}. [NOT SURE, TO BE REDISCUSSED]The super-linear behaviour of the central peaks can be explained by the proximity of dark exciton states. High power excitation can unlock radiative recombination path to states remaining nonradiative at low excitation power~\cite{PwSuperLinInc}. Such states linked to the $|0\rangle$ state make the emission on its peaks present a super-linear behaviour when excited at high power.

	\label{SimulCRossAuto}
	\end{figure}			
		
	To identify the main contribution to the observed spin fluctuations, we modelled the auto-correlation of the PL of X-Cr using the full spin level structure of a Cr-doped QD. We calculated the time evolution of the population of the twenty X-Cr states in the excited state of the QD and five Cr states in the ground state by solving numerically the master equation for the corresponding 25 x 25 density matrix $\rho$. The time evolution of the density matrix including relaxation and dephasing processes in the Lindblad form is given by $\partial \rho/\partial t=-i/\hbar[{\cal H},\rho]+L\rho$ where ${\cal H}$ is the Hamiltonian of the complete system ($X$-Cr and Cr) and $L\rho$ describes the coupling or decay channels resulting from an interaction with the environment \cite{SpinQJumps,ephBroad}. The energy levels of the Cr are controlled by the magnetic anisotropy $D_0S_z^2$. The X-Cr Hamiltonian, presented in Ref.\cite{LafuenteCrQD}, contains the energy of the Cr spin states, the carriers-Cr exchange interactions, the electron-hole exchange interaction in a confining potential of low symmetry and the structure of the valence band including heavy-hole/light-hole mixing. $D_0$ in the Cr Hamiltonian and the parameters in the X-Cr Hamiltonian cannot be precisely extracted from the zero magnetic field PL (Fig.~\ref{DotSpectra}(a)). For a qualitative description of the observed spin dynamics, we use in the model typical Cr-doped QD parameters extracted from magneto-optics measurements presented in Ref. \cite{LafuenteCrQD}. These parameters give a X-Cr splitting and a dark/bright excitons mixing similar to the one observed in the QD discussed in this article.
